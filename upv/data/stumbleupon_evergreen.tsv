to blow the mothballs off of this legendary masterpiece Solid hard nosed and pure Meet Pete Rose 49 Houston Aeros Away Jersey These designers have thrust their Aeros into the upper tier of the American Hockey League with this curious creation Aggressive yet elegant 48 Florida Panthers 3rd Jersey Blue and darker blue aren t exactly Panthers colors but this jersey as a whole reeks of solid domination On the other hand it also screams Pittsburgh Penguins 47 Pittsburgh Pirates Negro League Jersey There s nothing like Heritage Week to bring back the old days The Homestead Grays clearly believed in simplicity and class Less continues to be more 46 Edmonton Oil Kings Military Jersey This Western Hockey League club is prepared to do whatever it takes to cement its name in history forever And that includes fashioning a Jackson Pollack esque display of paint madness More simply referred to as the Military Appreciation Jerseys Abstract art at its finest 45 Cincinnati Stingers Away Jersey This 70s World Hockey Association masterpiece can t possibly be gulped all at once It s too powerful Here is the rest 44 Kingston Frontenacs Don Cherry Jersey The Kingston Frontenacs are still several suits away from reaching greatness but the Ontario Hockey League just got a lot cooler with this mockery of NHL analyst and nut Don Cherry Risky business though as this can often be misconstrued as brutal 43 Atlanta Braves Throwback Jersey Worn by Hank Aaron and his pack of Braves during the franchise s first two seasons in Atlanta 1966 67 this simple off white piece of cloth is a pleasant vacation for the pupils With a player number replacing the chest high tomahawk and an iconic badge on the sleeve these jerseys present solid compliments to the everyday white and red 42 Montreal Canadiens Throwback Jersey When the Canadiens broke out their 1910 11 Centennial jerseys few were ready for such festive aggression An early Christmas present 41 Missouri Tigers New Jersey Forget the heart of a lion This Missouri squad is ready to prove they possess the mind of a Tiger Enhanced durability makes these cats ferocious 40 North Stars Jersey Minnesota enjoyed the green and yellow North Stars from 1967 to 1993 before they moved to Dallas and became the Stars Minnesota Wild 2000 present brass evidently decided not to follow suit 39 Pittsburgh Steelers Throwback Jersey If these 80th season jerseys truly are inspired by bumblebees then due credit goes to those talented honey dwellers They may be tough on the eyes but these obtuse jerseys are a refreshing and necessary addition to the NFL Only in doses though 38 France New Away Jersey The stripe work may seem excessive but let s be real You can never have enough stripes Just as long as France doesn t get mistaken for a pack of referees 37 Anaheim Ducks Goldberg Jersey David Wright continues to amaze us with his potent disregard for the routine This is no regular Ducks sweater But it s clearly phenomenal 36 Montreal Canadiens Centennial Jersey These 1912 1913 throwbacks give us another reason to love stripes But we re still searching for Waldo 35 Turkey New Away Jersey Simple yet effective is the direction these designers seemed headed for The edgy lettering and gnarly ray of light shining from the back makes this potent presentation almost magical 34 Halifax Mooseheads Jersey The firm red shoulders pads curved lettering and complimentary script are the main ingredients for artistic brilliance The CHL is simply epic 33 California Golden Seals Jersey One of six teams added to the league as part of the 1967 NHL expansion the California Golden Seals never truly grasped the importance of winning on the ice they moved to Cleveland and became the Barons in 1976 They were clearly more focused on keeping their elegant white skates squeaky clean 32 Tampa Bay Lightning 3rd Jersey Released in 08 these silver trimmed knockouts are subtly intense It s refreshing The diagonal style lettering is a slight but necessary detail 31 Miami Heat Orange and Pink Jersey They only played in the ABA for two years 1968 1970 but that didn t keep today s superstars from remembering the Miami Floridians White pink orange black It might be too festive Though never too unique 30 Mighty Ducks of Anaheim 3rd Jersey Not only does the centerpiece bird look like a steroid struck or murderous version of Daffy Duck but he also appears ready to dominate the ice They re far from traditional and far from boring 29 Connecticut Whale Jersey Since 2010 this AHL uniform has dominated the competition The Hartford Whalers esque feel gives the Whale a mighty advantage on camera 28 Los Angeles Kings Throwback Jersey This purple and yellow elegance has rarely let down the illustrious Lakers so perhaps the Kings should turn back the clock and embrace their retro look Beating the Devils for the massive Stanley Cup would be a memorable first step to a new tradition 27 Maryland Terrapins New Jersey If the checkered oddly shaped new Maryland jerseys don t get your senses riled up perhaps their gold alternates will Loving the shoulder pad creativity at this moment although this wild flow may become a visual issue in the future 26 Portugal New Away Jersey The precise coloring cornered numbering and vibrant crosshairs make Portugal s new away kit one for the ages Quality over quantity 25 ZSC Lions Victoria Cup Jersey Founded in 1930 the ZSC Lions are clearly experienced in the art of victory But this Switzerland club proved they were more than just a stylish crew when they beat the Chicago Blackhawks in 2009 for the Victoria Cup trophy 24 Boston Bruins 3rd Jersey With a bear hogging the center there s little about this jersey that doesn t scream amazing We may despise Boston s hockey club but we love their Bruin 23 Washington Redskins Alternate Jersey These yellow and red studs are a refreshing clean cut addition to the often cliched gridiron fashion business Letter circling on the helmet makes this a knockout 22 Rutgers Scarlet Knights New Jersey Underneath this fresh style is an exuberant smile unable to contain itself Oh yes look closely The Scarlet Knights seem ready for battle 21 Montreal Canadiens Centennial Jersey Word has it that this blue masterpiece was only worn for one year 1909 1910 but man what a year it was Time for a comeback 20 England New Away Jersey Rugby is already grueling enough but with a duel kit like this few others have a chance The staredown is classic 19 New York Rangers Heritage Jersey 18 Memphis Grizzlies Throwback Jersey As our eyes steadily adjust to the vibrant presentation it becomes clear that the Memphis Grizzlies have an intricate plan for victory Pleasantly distract all viewers 17 France New Home Jersey A ferocious blue display is perfectly complimented by slight gold lettering on the chest and sleeves Nike s new France home kit has all of Western Europe in a euphoric state 16 San Antonio Spurs Throwback Jersey From 1967 to 1973 the Dallas Chaparrals were easily the most stunning pack of ballers in the ABA And then they moved to San Antonio long before the Spurs decided to pay necessary tribute 15 New York Mets Throwback Jersey It seems the Mets have finally realized the atrocity surrounding their black uniforms A legendary NY scripted on their chest seals the deal Respect for baseball s former New York Giants 14 Quidditch Olympics Jersey The nerdiest sport on the planet just became perhaps the most fashionable as well with the introduction of their 2012 Summer Olympic tops Muggles may not possess the power to soar on broom sticks but they clearly know what it takes to look good 13 Oakland Athletics Throwback Jersey Just picture mustache extraordinaire Rollie Fingers sporting the green and yellow stirrups Truly kicking it old school 12 Chicago Blackhawks Throwback Jersey This 1936 inspired sweater does everything to escape the norm The tribal logo sets the tone while the cream white and red striping puts the finishing touches Epic 11 Texas Rangers Throwback Jersey This 1976 powder blue home uniform rests officially as one of the best to have ever graced the diamond The colorfully striped rims are a nice touch 10 Detroit Red Wings Throwback Jersey During their Cougar days Detroit s beloved franchise fashioned an intricate yet clean arsenal This eye pleasing presentation would define the Original Six and the NHL for years to come 9 Croatia New Home Jersey The design team designated to Croatia s EURO 2012 home kit seems to be simultaneously poking at greatness and insanity But let s be real this is pure genius 8 Ottawa Senators Heritage Jersey It must ve been tough for Senators captain Daniel Alfredsson to contain his exuberance during this moment and we respect him for trying Sure the design is creatively perfect but it s the story behind the cloth that has us in a frenzy All it took was one suggestion from graphic designer Jacob Barrette on an Ottawa Senators message board 7 Chicago White Sox Throwback Jersey Dick Allen s hipster glasses and epic stare hog this intense moment but we re still intrigued by the powder blue button down The Ambrose Burnside sideburns complete this masterful shot 6 Los Angeles Lakers Throwback Jersey The Minneapolis Lakers would only last 13 years 1947 1960 but they certainly cemented their spot in sports lore with five George Mikan led championships and vibrant suits Perfection 5 Great Britain New Olympics Jersey Thank you Leicester Riders forward and national team captain Andrew Sullivan for the pink touch The glistening top reeks of class and the solid neck of aggression Nicely done 4 Cleveland Cavaliers Hardwood Classic Jersey We saw the Cavs sport a blue and orange top during LeBron James days but not so much this retro piece The 1970 s wine and gold look is a keeper 3 Ohio State Buckeyes Throwback Jersey In honor of the 1954 Buckeyes team the Ohio State football team was seen repping these artistic keepers at Michigan Stadium several years back From the intricate sleeve work to the simple yet engaging helmets these uniforms epically compliment the gridiron 2

shot for all Dodgers fans only in California of course The 1940 s road alternates help these West Coast superstars look the part rankings\/list, multiple sports, b\/r swagger, partners, sfgate,

the Royal Society of Chemistry wanted to find the perfect gravy recipe as part of their 2009 Year of Food project they went to Yorkshireman and chemist John Emsley He uses all the elements of a traditional roast to make his gravy from the meat juices to the water the vegetables are boiled in which add nutrients as well as flavour The perfect way to do the Sunday meal is with gravy from the joint Why waste the nutrients he says Start by cooking the joint on a bed of halved onions carrots and celery which juices from the meat will slowly trickle on to When the meat is cooked remove it from the roasting tin along with the vegetables Sprinkle a small amount of plain flour over the meat juices and fat Stir to form a dough or roux by gradually adding the water you ve boiled your accompanying vegetables in John says it works best with cabbage water If you boil things like cabbage you lose nutrients into the water Using that water in the gravy adds an extra little depth it s a way of putting that back into the meal Stir the gravy until all the meat juices and Marmite like deposits on the bottom of the roasting dish have dissolved Add iodised salt to taste and a teaspoon of soy sauce Perhaps a surprising addition soy sauce is a crucial ingredient because it reaches our fifth taste what the Japanese call umami Simmer to reduce the liquid to the right consistency stirring occasionally and then pour all over your traditional roast Souffl Penny Lewis who runs cookery courses at The Culinary Cottage near Abergavenny South Wales which deal with supposedly tricky dishes is confident that anyone can make a souffl that is lovely and light Most people are just frightened of it she says You do need a good whisk and a clean bowl Have it all in place before you start and the oven at the right temperature having the right equipment and ingredients to hand is important so you can time it right Preheat the oven to 200C Generously butter a 15cm souffl dish and coat with finely grated parmesan Separate four large eggs Melt 30g butter in a saucepan stir in 30g of plain flour half a teaspoon of mustard and a pinch of cayenne pepper Cook for a minute or two remove from the heat and stir in 225ml of full fat milk Return it to the heat whisking until thickened and continue to cook for a few minutes while continually whisking Remove from the heat Then stir in between 85g and 110g of either strong cheddar or gruy\u00e8re cheese followed by the egg yolks and salt and pepper Whisk the egg whites in a very clean bowl until they are stiff but not dry Gently fold in the cheese mixture with a metal spoon and pour into a souffl dish Run your thumb around the top edge of the dish for the top hat effect suggests Penny Bake for 25 to 30 minutes until it is golden brown and well risen To check if your souffl is ready open the oven door slightly but not before 20 minutes has elapsed and give the dish a gentle shove if it just wobbles it s ready if it is very wobbly allow five more minutes But the real key to souffl success is to eat it quickly Penny s final rule Make sure your guests are at the table and ready to eat when you get your souffl out of the oven Basmati rice Rice is one of those basic accompaniments that we should all be able to manage yet it so often ends up sticky We turned to Michelin starred chef Alfred Prasad from Indian restaurant Tamarind for his approach It s very easy he says This method applies to all good quality rice First measure your rice in a liquid measurement say 500ml Alfred insists that soaking the rice a process we might be tempted to skip is really important Grains of rice rub against each in the packet which produces a starchy powder and soaking gets rid of that he says After 10 to 15 minutes drain and then rinse the rice two or three times until it is no longer milky Measure your water using double the quantity of rice one litre of water for 500ml of rice Use a vessel at least twice its volume and put the water on to boil As soon as the water is boiling turn down the heat and throw in the soaked rinsed rice People do use salt but it s really not required says Alfred Another useful tip which probably won t go down well with the healthy eating brigade is to add a teaspoon of vegetable oil to keep the rice from sticking Stir the rice a couple of times to stop it from clumping at the bottom Alfred recommends using a spatula rather than a spoon and bring it back to the boil Once you get to the point when there is no more moisture on the top of the rice but while it is still fairly wet at the bottom turn the heat off he says Alfred then leaves the pan open without a lid so that all the excess steam can clear Leave for 10 minutes then transfer to your serving dish Meringues We all dream of fluffy cloud like creations with outer crunch and inner goo but may find ourselves brought back down to earth with browned flattened lumps Lynn Bolton has mastered the art and has up a mail order meringue company Head in the Clouds dedicated to selling her confections She shares her secrets for the classic meringue nest Ensure you have clean bowls and equipment any grease will deflate the meringue she says My Nan taught me to wipe out the bowls and the equipment with vinegar Pre heat the oven to 130C You need 200g of egg whites at room temperature and 400g of good quality white caster sugar If your eggs weigh in at 195g or 210g don t worry just double this weight for the sugar content says Lynn Meringues are pure chemistry sugar and egg white in a ratio of 2 to 1 Weigh the egg white as well as the sugar you can t go wrong Put the egg whites and sugar in a heat proof bowl stir to remove any lumps and place over a saucepan of just boiling water Make sure the bottom of the basin does not touch the water Leave over the water for around eight to 10 minutes stirring occasionally and checking that the sugar has melted Transfer to a mixing bowl to whisk Set a timer for 10 minutes Using an electric whisk beat for five minutes and then add seeds scraped from one vanilla pod and a few drops of vanilla essence Continue beating and feel the bowl as you go it will cool as the air is beaten into the mixture After eight minutes take the beaters out of the meringue and see if it holds its shape If it isn t stiff then beat for a further two minutes and test again before using the mixture Don t over beat the meringue it should be glossy like a gloss paint and not dull says Lynn Transfer the meringue mix on to a large lined baking tray Quickly work the meringue mixture into a round Approximately 200mm circumference so it is still nice and deep says Lynn and make a shallow well in the middle Put into the preheated oven and then immediately turn the temperature down to 110C Cook for three hours Check that the meringue is firm on the base by gently easing it off the tray and tapping it If at any point you think the meringue is going to give stop and cook for a further 30 minutes Once you are happy that it sounds dull this means it is still gooey inside and the base is firm turn the oven off Pastry Some of us might reach for the ready made stuff out of the supermarket freezer section but Gerhard Jenne of London based bakers Konditor Cook insists that making sweet pastry is literally as easy as one two three The recipe we use is very basic it s the 1 2 3 method one part sugar two parts butter and three parts flour You don t even need scales If you want to make it a bit finer you could also add an egg yolk says Gerhard The most important thing is the sugar itself he says Never use granulated sugar it s too coarse and can taste a bit gritty When you bake it the grains go splodgy He recommends using good caster sugar or for a really fine pastry icing sugar Pastry is never going to be a health food and Gerhard refuses to skimp on the salt suggesting that you should add it or use salted butter to bring out the flavour If you re using egg yolk start with the sugar and yolk add the grease and then the flour You can mix it by hand which Gerhard insists is quite easy to do although they use a food processor It comes together fairly quickly but once it is together you don t want to overwork it do it fairly speedily says Gerhard Once you ve got a nice dough don t mess about wrap it in clingfilm and pop it in the fridge to chill for half an hour Once you ve taken it out of the fridge knead it or work it over a couple of times it won t need much pastry is pretty pliable Then roll it out with as little flour as possible You don t want a residue it won t look very nice he adds A common problem with pastry that often it is not cooked properly Gerhard recommends quite a hot oven of between 180C and 200C depending on the size of your dish Cook it until it is golden there s nothing worse than undercooked pale pastry it s a bit insipid White sauce A white sauce or bchamel to give it its more intimidating name is the classic base for many a sauce Top chef Paul Gayler whose book Sauce is dedicated to the art of making a great sauce tells us how to get it lump free Start by halving a small onion and stud each half with two cloves Place in a pan with 600ml of full fat milk and a small bay leaf The onion cloves and bay leaf infuse the milk making it aromatic says Paul Bring the milk to the boil and simmer gently for four to five minutes In another pan make a roux Begin by melting 45g of butter and add 45g of plain flour Cook for 30 to 40 seconds stirring frequently until the roux is pale yellow Make sure you have equal amounts of butter and flour so you get a nice smoothness If you have too much flour it ll be sandy and never cook out Put the milk through a fine strainer then beat it vigorously into the roux and stir until the sauce is smooth Using a wooden spoon to stir it gives it a lovely silky appearance and you can slap the sauce up against the sides says Paul Slowly bring the bchamel to the boil reduce the heat and then simmer it for 20 minutes beating occasionally until the sauce is smooth and glossy Cook it nice and slowly You need to simmer it to allow the flour to cook out Stick it in the blender if it goes wrong if it s too lumpy a blender will bring it back he says "",""url"":""independent co uk life style food and drink features the six skills every cook really needs 1962376

with Nicole s recipe to incorporate my love of chocolate and now I can add sugared chocolate spiced muffins to my collection of easy chocolate recipes Thank you for the inspiration Nicole If you haven

doughnuts I would have an extremely difficult time choosing which was which I love sugar donuts and I never realized the tastes would be so similar to muffins but they are The texture of the sugar donut muffin is pillow soft on the inside and super moist It has a crispy sugar coating on the outside with a hint of nutmeg in every bite The sugared chocolate spiced muffin was similar in texture It looks like a muffin but tastes more like a chocolate spiced cake When you take a bite you instantly get the sweetness from the sugar and the nutmeg with a mild chocolate flavour but it s quickly replaced with heat from the cinnamon If you re looking for an alternative to the typical sweet chocolate muffin recipes this is it My kitchen looked like a doughnut shop last night The island was covered in muffins delicious donuts chocolate glaze and cinnamon sugar and just like a doughnut shop I was baking till the wee hours of the morning Before I knew it 4 00 am rolled around I guess that

beverages the problem is most of these same people don t realize the volume of calories they are putting in their bodies when they consume these products Even freshly squeezed juices are very calorie dense If you are pounding back any of these drinks on a regular basis cutting them out could do wonders for your waste line without even adding in any exercise This list will be from the least calorie dense drinks all the way up to the super calorie dense options And since I am such a nice guy I m even going to suggest a few low calorie alternatives to help give you something to sip on over the day 8 7 11 Cola SlurpeeThis one seems almost obvious although I was shocked to see it this low on the list when compared to some of the other popular drinks Slurpee Nutritional InfoOz 24 Calories 210Fat 0gCarbs 53 9gProtein Sugar 53 9gCalories Per oz 8 75Alternatives to SlurpeesWhile I personally love a Slurpee on a hot summers day one alternative is a home made calorie free Slurpee Take your blender mix in roughly 1 2 cup of pre made crystal light and then add roughly half a tray of ice cubes more if you want it slushier Blend the concoction up for a calorie free Slurpee 7 Pepsi Cola Coca Cola Another obvious one near the top of the list is sugar packed sodas such as Coke or Pepsi Your average 12oz serving has roughly 150 calories If you drink three cans a day that s 160200 calories a year which is roughly 45 lbs of PURE FAT Pepsi Nutritional Info Oz 12Calories 150Fat 0gCarbs 42gProtein Sugar 42gCalories Per oz 12 50Alternatives to Pepsi Coke SodasThis is actually a really easy fix if you are willing to make a bit of a change Switch from Pepsi to Diet Pepsi The taste might not be that pleasing at first but after a few weeks you don t even notice the aftertaste any more I personally actually prefer diet sodas over regular these days If you drink diet soda you are 100 reducing these drink calories from your diet 6 Fresh Orange JuiceYes you are reading this correctly Juices are jam packed full of calories whether you are drinking apple juice orange juice or grape juice they all contain a ton of sugar and a ton of unnecessary calories If you really just want some vitamin C take a supplement or eat an actual orange and get some of the fiber to go along with it Fresh Orange Juice Nutrition InfoOz 12Calories 170Fat 0 8gCarbs 39 2gProtein 2 6Sugar 31 7gCalories Per oz 14 17Fresh Juice Alternatives If you are drinking juice for Vitamins eat the fruit and get some of the benefits of the fiber If you are just looking for something that has some flavor mix up some Crystal Light and enjoy a tasty calorie free drink 5 GatoradeIf Gatorade is good for athletes it has got to be good for me right WRONG Gatorade was developed to help athletes quickly replenish depleted energy sources and as a result is jam packed full of sugar as well as calories Unless you are performing at a very high level athletically drinking Gatorade is only going to build your spare tire around your waste Gatorade Nutrition Info Oz 12Calories 170Fat 0 8gCarbs 39 2gProtein 2 6Sugar 31 7gCalories Per oz 25 83Gatorade Alternatives If you really want to drink a sports drink pickup one of Gatorade s new G2 sports drinks It is a low calorie alternative and won t turn you into an overweight wannabe athlete 4 Starbucks Mint Chocolaty Chip Frappuccino blended creme with Chocolate Whipped Cream Let s face it you shouldn t be drinking Starbucks Frappuccino s if you are trying to watch your waste line They are so packed full of calories you could easily gain a pound a week by drinking a Venti every day One Frapp stands out in the crowd for being the ultimate weight gainer and that is the Mint Chocolaty Chip Frappuccino blended cr\u00e8me with Chocolate Whipped Cream try saying that 5 times This drink is a behemoth with 680 calories in a single 24oz serving That is an astounding 28 33 calories per oz If you are planning on dressing up as Santa Clause this winter and don t want to stuff your pants with pillows this is definitely the daily beverage for you Starbucks Mint Chocolaty Chip Frappuccino blended creme with Chocolate Whipped Cream Nutrition InfoOz 24Calories 680Fat 21gCarbs 115gProtein 18Sugar 93gCalories Per oz 28 33Frappuccino Alternatives If you are really feeling the urge to get a blended Frapp from Starbucks first step is to look at the light section The next step is to select the Espresso Frappuccino Light Blended Coffee A Venti 24oz serving still has 150 calories but that is substantially better than its Mint Chocolaty companion For those who care the Espresso Frappuccino Light Blended Coffee packs 6 25 calories per oz 3 7 11 French Vanilla Caf\u00e9 Cooler7 11 got a little upset when Starbucks started stealing their grown up Slurpee customers who wanted blended coffee So what did they do They came up with Coffee Slurpees to stir up the competition Unlucky for us though these Slurpees come packed with nearly four times the calories of a traditional Slurpee Check out the nutritional information on these tasty morsels 7 11 French Vanilla Caf\u00e9 Cooler Nutrition Info Oz 20 Calories 634Fat 27gCarbs 97gProtein 1 6Sugar 97gCalories Per oz 31 70French Vanilla Caf\u00e9 Alternatives Honestly if you have to buy something from 7 11 to replace your French Vanilla Caf\u00e9 Cooler I would recommend grabbing a cup of coffee toss a bit of skim milk and some sugar free Vanilla syrup in it Run over to the Big Gulp machine and toss a few ice cubes in your cup to cool it down and make a chilled beverage Aside from that any of the caf\u00e9 coolers are pretty much going to turn you into a fat air balloon 2 McDonald s Chocolate Triple Thick ShakeLeave it to McDonalds to have the second most fattening drink that I have ever seen If you ve ever tasted their Chocolate Triple Thick Shake you would know instantly that there is no way something with so much creamy tasty flavor could ever be good for you This calorie behemoth could help you pack on as much as two pounds of fat a week when combined with your normal diet Pretty impressive huh Chocolate Triple Thick Shake Nutrition Info Oz 32 Calories 1160Fat 27gCarbs 203gProtein 27Sugar 168gCalories Per oz 36 25Chocolate Triple Thick Shake Alternatives If you really want to drink a Chocolate milk shake you are looking at a calorie dense beverage no matter what way you shake it If you want to make something that is at least somewhat healthy for you blend 1 2 cup skim milk with 2 scoops chocolate whey protein and half a tray of ice It will taste like a chocolate milk shake with way less sugar but you still can t avoid the calories 1 Bubble Tea with Milk and Tapioca PearlsBubble Tea is an Asian drink that has many variations these days The original Bubble Tea came from Taiwan and was a combination of Black tea condensed milk honey and pearls tapioca balls These days the black tea and condensed milk can be substituted with fruity teas or milky fruit teas all of which are jam packed with gut producing calories A standard Bubble Tea with milk and pearls contains roughly 510 calories in just a 12 oz serving If you just broke out your calculator you would now know that Bubble tea can contain 42 50 calories per oz What does that mean for you It means that Bubble Tea is a one way ticket to Obesity Boulevard Bubble Tea with Milk and Tapioca Pearls Nutritional Info Oz 12 Calories 510Fat 20 4gCarbs 79 05gProtein 6Sugar gCalories Per oz 42 50Bubble Tea Alternatives Alright this one you are going to have to suck up and just stop drinking There is absolutely no reason why you need to eat Tapioca balls and condensed milk on a daily basis Hit up your grocery store and grab a couple boxes of black and green tea Not only will it save your health it will also save you some money "",""url"":""infobarrel 8 Drinks That Will Make You Fat""}"	"?"

(that might be a pregnancy thing) i wanted massive amounts of frosting. (that might be a pregnancy thing too) hence, i bucked every traditional mold i had seen for a vertical layer cake and made my own. sorry. the second time making the cake i was surprised by how quickly everything went. its amazing..."",""url"":""iammommy typepad i am baker 2011 02 vertical layer cake tutororial html""}"	"?"

Best Taunting Moments in Sports the best taunting moments in sports"",""body"":""All the talk in sports these days is about decorum respect and cleaning up the game Have you seen the NFL s new regulations for on field antics But let s be honest Taunting is one of the great things about sports Many of the great moments we remember from Jordan s tongue wag to Muhammad Ali standing menacingly over Liston were pure taunts Here are the greatest taunts in sports history No 20 Sean Avery Mocks Maxime Talbot Hockey players like being seen as tough guys and getting into big fights on the ice So what could be worse for Talbot than listening to iconoclast Sean Avery mock his punches No 19 Terrell Owens Mocks Ray Lewis Ray Lewis dance was among both the most feared and ridiculous antics on the gridiron It s funny that the NFL s most flamboyant wide receiver was the only man with the guts to mock it No 18 Roy Jones Jr Mocks Glen Kelly In his heyday Roy Jones was the world s best boxer and head and shoulders better than anyone in his weight class He was so good that he actually put his hands behind his back to taunt Glen Kelly and then he knocked him out for good measure No 17 Philip Rivers Taunts Jay Cutler Once upon a time Jay Cutler was Philip Rivers West Coast rival The two star quarterbacks hated one another So when the Broncos were down 23 3 in their 2007 AFC West battle Rivers decided to wave goodbye just to rub the loss in a little bit deeper No 16 Joe Namath Calls the Score Is it a taunt to call the score before the Super Bowl Who knows but the iconic Namath did it against the Baltimore Colts and when he got it right he secured his place in the NFL s Hall of Fame No 15 Albert Belle Threatens Kevin Kennedy Belle no stranger to controversy didn t take kindly to Boston manager Kevin Kennedy s claims that he used a corked bat Flashing his bicep threateningly at Kennedy he said There s your cork No 14 Terrell Owens Attacks the Dallas Star The Cowboys star is one of the most sacred symbols in Texas Owens repeatedly disrespected it in this 2000 game as a 49er and he made an enemy of Cowboys fans for years Ironically Owens joined Dallas years later and put up some of the best numbers of his career representing the star No 13 Reggie Bush vs the Bears Defense Down 16 7 against Chicago Reggie Bush caught a pass from Drew Brees and used his electric speed to outrun the entire Bears defense The funniest part He managed to point at them the entire last 15 yards to his touchdown Still the Bears had the last laugh defeating the Saints to advance to the 2006 Super Bowl in Miami No 12 Randy Moss Moons Green Bay Fans Randy Moss is one of the all time maverick personalities in NFL history Who else would moon opposing fans in the 2004 NFC Wild Card Game No 11 Boston Fans Taunt Darryl Strawberry Boston fans were desperate to win the 1986 World Series and they pulled out all the stops In fact they were so harsh that they inspired a Simpsons parody No 10 Babe Ruth Calls His Home Run Did the Babe actually do it It doesn t matter The fact that people believe Ruth declared he would hit a home run to center field during the World Series then actually did it says everything you need to know about one of baseball s most historic players No 9 Yankees Fans Taunt Pedro Martinez Pedro Martinez delivered an assist to the Yankees when he said They beat me they re that good right now I just tip my hat and call the Yankees my daddy The Yankees responded with Who s your daddy Who s your daddy It was certainly a far cry from Pedro s manhandling dominance of the Yankees in his golden years from 1997 2000 No 8 Scottie Pippen Dunks on Ewing Scottie gets credit for a two for one Not only did he dunk on New York Knicks star Patrick Ewing embarrassing him he also taunted uber fan Spike Lee and put him in his place It s exactly what the Chicago Bulls did to New York for most of the 1990s No 7 Donald Sterling Taunts His Own Player Phil Jackson discussing Sterling s karma Only the Donald the one without the world famous hair would actually taunt his own star player on the court Sure Davis was wasting 13 million of Sterling s money per year but would taunting from your own owner motivate you to play better No 6 Michael Jordan Finger Wags Dikembe Mutombo Watch the wag at 1 20 Mutombo s finger wag is one of the best taunts of all time Jordan who loved to humiliate his opponents couldn t resist turning it right back on Mutombo No 5 Reggie Miller Chokes Spike Lee In the mid 1990s the greatest rivalry wasn t between players It was between one visiting player Reggie Miller and filmmaker Spike Lee No 4 Manny Pacquiao s Mini Concert What s the best way to say You didn t hurt me to your opponent Participate in a concert after the fight How do you feel about that Miguel Cotto No 3 Dikembe Mutombo s Finger Wag The big man s finger wag would have gotten old except that he was just so good at blocking shots How could his rejection notice get

\""last meal ribs,\"" the best barbecue ribs you've ever tasted on labor day, make \""last meal ribs,\"" the best barbecue ribs you've ever tasted"",""body"":""Here s how to make low and slow smoke roasted Last Meal Ribs on just about any covered grill and make slabs better than they do in restaurants You ll never boil ribs again That s because water is a solvent and it pulls much of the flavor out of the meat When you boil meat you make soup You wouldn t boil a steak would you If you boil ribs the terrorists win There s nothing revolutionary in this method Envision a proto human tribe padding warily through the fragrant ashes of a forest fire as they follow a particularly seductive scent When they stumble upon the charred carcass of a wild boar they squat and poke their fingers into its side They sniff their hands then lick their greasy digits The magical blend of warm protein molten fat and unctuous collagen in the roasted meat is a narcotic elixir and it addicts them on first bite They become focused obsessed with tugging out the rib bones and scraping them clean between their teeth moaning and shaking their heads The aromas make their nostrils smile and the flavors cause their mouths to weep They sing praises to their gods Now imagine your tribe your family and friends moaning in ecstasy and praising your name in your own backyard You can make it happen if you follow my step by step guide below I share this with you after years of studying at the feet of the masters judging at barbecue competitions including the Jack Daniel s World Championship International Barbecue and sucking on a lot of bones We re talking Southern ribs here a style created by African slaves and as uniquely American as their other great contributions to our culture Jazz and the blues The ribs that win championships are a melange of flavors Spice rub hardwood smoke tangy sweet sauce all underpinned by the distinct flavor of pork They are juicy and tender and they tug cleanly off the bone They do not fall off the bone They have the texture of other properly cooked meats like steaks Click here to see what I look for when I judge rib cookoff what I consider to be Amazing Ribs There may be a few more steps in this process than you like but it s not hard and we re talking blue ribbon competition grade meat here If you love ribs follow these steps and you will thank me as so many others have Serves 2 adults Preparation time Overnight dry rub marinating is optional Cooking time We will be cooking low and slow so allow 5 hours for St Louis Cut ribs my faves and 3 hours for baby back ribs Hardware 1 grill with a cover You can use a dedicated smoker or any charcoal grill or gas grill as long as it has a cover A tight fitting cover with adjustable vents like those on the Weber Kettle is best 1 18 pound bag of charcoal for charcoal grills or smokers You won t use all that charcoal but because you will need more on cold windy or wet days than on sunny and warm days have a full bag on hand Hardwood lump is best but regular briquets will do fine Absolutely do not use the instant igniting stuff that has solvent in it Chimney starters are by far the best way to start charcoal especially for long slow cooking where the smell of the solvent in charcoal starter fluid can ruin the taste of the meat 1 tank of propane for gas cookers You won t need it all but until you get the hang of this technique don t risk running out by starting with a partial tank 8 ounces by weight of hardwood chunks chips or pellets It doesn t matter how many slabs you are cooking 8 ounces should be enough I prefer chunks of apple oak or hickory for pork Never use any kind of pine unless you want meat that tastes like turpentine Never use construction lumber because it is often treated with poisonous chemicals to discourage rot and termites You do not need to soak the wood Wood does not absorb much water That s why they make boats with it 1 pair of long handled tongs 1 sauce brush preferably one of those newfangled silicon brushes 12 feet of heavy duty aluminum foil not the lightweight stuff 1 good instant read thermometer preferably digital 1 six pack of beer for the cook not the meat 1 lawn chair 1 good book Tunes Software 1 slab of fresh St Louis Cut SLC ribs That s 1 2 slab per adult If you use baby back ribs get a whole slab per person You may have leftovers but what s wrong with that SLCs are the meatiest and most flavorful ribs They are spare ribs with the tips removed so they form a nice rectangular rack You can use baby back ribs if you prefer They are smaller and cook faster Country ribs come from the shoulder and are not really ribs so don t use them for this recipe Get fresh not frozen meat if possible Fresh meat has the best pork flavor and the most moisture Ever notice the pink liquid when you defrost meat You can t get that back into the meat so buy fresh meat whenever possible Ask the butcher to remove the membrane on the back side 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 4 tablespoons of Meathead s Memphis Dust or a similar spice rub 1 cup apple juice 1 cup of your signature homemade barbecue sauce or a good commercial barbecue sauce Do this 1 Rinse Rinse the ribs in cool water to remove any bone bits from the butchering and any bacterial film that grew in the package don t worry cooking will sterilize the meat Pat dry with paper towels 2 Skin n trim If the butcher has not removed the membrane from the back side do it yourself Insert a butter knife under the membrane then your fingers shown at right work a section loose grip it with a paper towel and peel it off Finally trim the excess fat from both sides Click here to see more photos of how to skin n trim 3 Rub Coat the meat with a thin layer of cooking oil Sprinkle enough Meathead s Memphis Dust to coat all surfaces but not so much that the meat doesn t show through That is about 2 tablespoons per side depending on the size of the slab Many of the herbs and spices in the rub are oil soluble so the cooking oil will help them penetrate a little better Spread the Memphis Dust on the meat and rub it in Wash your hands Wrap the meat in half the foil and let it sit in the fridge for at least 4 hours on a platter or pan to catch leaks In addition to flavoring the meat the salt in the rub pulls the juices to the surface and that will help form a crust during the cooking If you don t have time to let the meat marinate in the dry rub it s not the end of the world Put on the oil and rub anyway and start cooking 4 Setup for indirect 2 zone cooking That means that one side is hot and the other is not If you have a gas grill use only one burner as described in my article setup for a gas grill Put a disposable aluminum pan with water on top of the hot burner Moisture and combustion gasses in a propane grill combine to create a seductive baconlike flavor in the meat If it has only one burner put the water pan between the meat and the burner If you have a charcoal grill push the coals to one side as in the photo at right and as described in best setup for a charcoal grill You can use a water pan but it is not necessary If you have an offset firebox smoker follow my instructions for an setting up an offset smoker If you have a bullet smoker like the Weber Smokey Mountain read my article bullet smoker setup 5 Adjust the temp Preheat your cooker to about 225F and try to keep it there throughout the cook Adjust the air intake dampers at the bottom to control heat on charcoal grills Intake dampers are more effective than exhaust dampers for controlling the temp because they reduce the supply of oxygen to the coals Take your time getting the temp right Cooking at 225F will allow the meat to roast low and slow liquefying the collagen in connective tissues and melting fats without getting the proteins knotted in a bunch It s a magic temp that creates silky texture adds moisture and keeps the meat tender If you can t hit 225F get as close as you can Don t go under 200F and try not to go over 250F Click here for more about meat science and the thermodynamics of cooking 6 Smoke For charcoal or gas cookers add 4 ounces of wood at this time Put the wood right on top of the flame of a gas grill or on the hot coals Resist the temptation to add more wood Nothing will ruin a meal faster and waste money better than oversmoked meat You can always add more the next time you cook but you cannot take it away if you oversmoke 7 Relax Put the slabs in the cooker on the cooler side of the grill meaty side up Close the lid and go drink a beer and read a book 8 More smoke When the smoke disappears after 20 30 minutes add another 2 ounces of wood After the first hour stop adding wood Adding wood at the beginning of the cook allows better penetration before the meat surface seals itself If you have more than one slab on halfway through the cook you will need to move the ribs closest to the fire away from the heat and the slabs far from the flame in closer Leave the meat side up There is no need to flip the slabs Otherwise keep your lid on Opening the lid just upsets the delicate balance of heat moisture and oxygen inside your cooker It can also significantly lengthen the cooking time No peeking If you re lookin you ain t cookin 9 The Texas Crutch Now we employ another secret of the champions The Texas Crutch After 3 hours of cooking St Louis Cut ribs at 225F 1 1 2 hours for baby backs take 6 of heavy duty foil and fold it into a 3 length Lay the slab on the foil meaty side up Fold up the sides making a boat and pour 1 cup of apple juice into the boat Don t pour it on the meat or you ll wash off the rub Now carefully fold the foil around the meat sealing it tight and trying hard not to puncture the foil Be careful those bones can poke through Put the packet back on the grill for 30 60 minutes No more than 60 minutes By creating a little steam The Texas Crutch adds flavor moisture tenderness and finishes cooking the meat If you want to skip this step feel free you ll still have killer ribs 10 Sauce Now take the meat out of the foil being careful not to curl your eyebrows with the steam when you open the packet and place the ribs back on at 225F for another hour to firm up the surface Then paint both sides with your favorite home made barbecue sauce or storebought sauce and move them directly over the hottest part of the grill in order to caramelize and crisp the sauce On a charcoal grill just move the slab over the coals On a gas grill crank up all the burners On a water smoker remove the water pan and move the meat close to the coals On an offset smoker put a grate over the coals in the firebox and put the meat there With the lid open so you don t roast the meat from above sizzle the sauce on one side and then the other One coat of a thick sauce should be enough but if you need two go ahead but no more Don t hide all the fabulous flavors under too much sauce If you think you ll want more sauce put some in a bowl on the table If you ve done all this right you will notice that there is a thin pink layer beneath the surface of the meat This does not mean it is undercooked It is the highly prized smoke ring caused by the combustion gases and the smoke It is a sign of Amazing Ribs Now be ready to take a bow when the applause swells from the audience Optional Instead of using barbecue sauce make Vermont Pig Candy shown at the top of this page This is always a huge hit Here s a summary of the process Pour the apple juice from the foil into a sauce pan and mix it with 1 4 cup of real maple syrup not artificially flavored pancake syrup and cook it about 15 minutes on medium high heat or until it starts to foam Watch it carefully and take it off the moment it foams Then add 2 pinches of salt and 2 teaspoons of hot sauce more or less Paint this wonderful glaze on the meat and put it back on the grill over high heat with the lid open and watch it carefully because it can burn easily The moment it begins to sizzle and bubble turn it and sizzle it on the other side Serve it and wait for the compliments Serve with Bourbon Baked BeansCreamy Deli Slaw or Sweet Sour

snacks"",""body"":""The snack is often a child s favorite part of her packed school lunch but ready made store bought snacks can be filled with preservatives chemical additives flavoring coloring agents and sweeteners To avoid the potential health risks associated with childhood obesity poor eating habits and processed foods many parents opt to pack healthy alternatives These are ten of the options that both you and your child can feel good about packed with kid pleasing flavor but none of the byproducts of processing Fruit Leathers Fruit leathers are the all natural alternative to processed neon colored gummy fruit snacks and are usually a big hit with the smaller set You can often find these treats in the organic section of your local grocery store but they re also relatively simple to make at home Fresh Fruit Few things compete with fresh fruit when it comes to providing kids with snacks that they ll willingly eat and their parents can provide with no guilt To avoid pesticides and other questionable commercial agricultural compounds opt for organic At the very least wash fruit thoroughly before serving or packing it Homemade Baked Goods When you make muffins and other treats from scratch you control everything that goes into them While many of the more popular mixes do have preservatives and other chemicals in them to extend their shelf life or prevent caking there are organic offerings that don t To avoid some of the fats in many baked items simply replace cooking oils with applesauce Roasted Soy Nuts Roasting soy nuts is quick simple and renders a healthier alternative to savory snacks They pack quite a punch in the crunch category with plenty of flavor that will please kids and adults alike One fourth of a cup of toasted soy nuts contains 11 grams of protein 117 calories and 6 grams of fat Apple Slices and Organic Peanut Butter There s something about the flavor of apples and peanut butter that complement one another beautifully To ensure that your little one is snacking on wholesome natural ingredients opt for organic peanut butter Sunbutter and soy nut butter can be substituted for kids that attend peanut free schools or are sensitive to peanuts Because kids can be finicky about eating fruit that s discolored swipe a slice of lemon over each apple section before packing it This will prevent browning that can be unappetizing to youngsters Ants On a Log Celery peanut butter and raisins are collectively known as Ants On a Log and have been a favorite for generations of kids As with other recipes containing peanut butter it can be substituted with sunbutter or soy nut butter to comply with peanut free school regulations or to ease hunger pangs in peanut sensitive tummies Popcorn Popcorn can be a very healthy snack but the microwave variety has been linked to a shocking number of dangerous potentially carcinogenic chemicals For all of the convenience of microwaved popcorn with none of the oils chemicals and additives simply toss a \u00bd cup of regular popcorn kernels in a no frills brown lunch bag and microwave until popping slows to two seconds Roasted Kale Even kids that snub all forms of leafy green produce will flip for roasted kale which gives potato chips a run for their flavorful money and contain none of the questionable ingredients Just remove the veins from kale leaves and toss them in a scant amount of olive oil Roast at 400 for roughly five minutes turn and continue roasting for another 7 to 10 Pull them out of the oven before they start to turn brown and sprinkle with a little bit of sea salt You ll be surprised at how difficult it is to keep a supply of roasted kale when your little ones discover how tasty it is Dried Fruit Sulphur dioxide a sulphite preservative has been linked to health concerns and is often present in large amounts in commercially processed dried fruit The World Health Organization recommends that sulphite preservatives be avoided or phased out whenever possible To keep sulphite preservatives out of your kids dried fruit it might be wise to invest in a relatively inexpensive food dehydrator The investment is a sound one if your kids are big dried fruit fans as it will allow you to dry a variety of fresh produce and serve it with no traces of sulphur dioxide Homemade Trail Mix Tossing your homemade dried fruit with a selection of organically harvested nuts and other goodies to make a healthy additive free trail mix is a great option for kids that have no known sensitivities to nuts just be sure that your child s school doesn t restrict tree nuts as a matter of policy Keeping your kids healthy and their diet free of potentially dangerous chemicals can be easier than you realize it simply requires an investment of time Experiment with healthy unprocessed snacks to find others that everyone in your family will love and kick the processed habit for good "",""url"":""findababysitter org blog 10 alternative to

visual guide to cooking with onions and garlic at epicurious.com"",""body"":""B ulb vegetables which include onions garlic and ramps all related and members of the lily family are usually just culinary accents Add in small amounts and they ll make a dish come alive with aromatic undertones When used raw they add a punch to salads and salsas But the real magic takes place when they re cooked A light saut\u00e9 or slow roast mellows their pungent acrid flavors and coaxes out their natural sweetness There are many different ways to categorize bulb vegetables so named because we consume the bulb Spring bulbs such as scallions and ramps need refrigeration Look for greens that are neither limp nor brown and white bulbs that are firm Storage bulbs are more typically onionlike round thin skinned vegetables that can simply be kept out in a dark dry place Chives are technically related to onions and garlic but are generally considered to be an herb For seeds visit your local plant nursery or visit online stores such as John Scheepers Kitchen Garden Seeds For buying and preparation advice for these bulb vegetables check out our tips Spanish onion Characteristics This storage onion is relatively mild but not as much as sweet onions Round with a thin brownish papery skin Spanish onions are the most common type of onion in the United States Pictured is a yellow Spanish onion but they are also available as red and white If a recipe simply calls for an onion a Spanish onion is the one to use For recipes using Spanish onions click here Shallots Alternate Names Gray Shallot Red ShallotCharacteristics The shallot often looks more like garlic than an onion because of its small bulbous cluster and thin dry coppery brown skin Individual shallot cloves resemble oversized garlic cloves with their pointed tapered ends except that the shallot possesses a luminescent purple hue Its flavor is milder than an onion s but its bite is still sharp when uncooked While the French incorporate the shallot into many dishes it s also popular throughout southeast Asian cuisine as in Goreng Bawang an Indonesian recipe for fried shallots For recipes using shallots click here White onion Characteristics This storage onion is named for the color of its thin skin and flesh With a taste that s more tangy than sweet or sour this is the onion of choice when making Latin and Central American dishes especially Mexican food For recipes using white onions click here Garlic Characteristics A truly international vegetable garlic is sold many ways whole bulb already peeled cloves pre sliced and minced At the farmers market newly harvested garlic is sometimes sold with the curled green stems still attached to the bulb the ends of which are called scapes Scapes can be prepared and consumed in a myriad of ways finely chopped saut\u00e9ed and served like chives and scallions An unpeeled garlic clove doesn t have a very strong scent but once the clove s body has been damaged a pungent odor is released To get garlic that s sweet and fragrant either saut\u00e9 or roast it But be careful not to burn the garlic which will result in an acrid smell For recipes using garlic click here Pearl onions Characteristics These very small onions are valued for their sweet delicate flavor and are usually served as an accompaniment Pearl onions can be creamed roasted or glazed Italians use balsamic vinegar Middle Easterners apply tamarind Pickled pearl onions make a great garnish to the classic martini And since peeling such small onions can be a chore look for frozen pre peeled ones at your market For recipes using pearl onions click here Red onion Alternate name Purple onionCharacteristics The bright reddish purple skin makes this onion hard to miss it s a favorite ingredient in salads To many palates red onions have the sharpest flavor in the family so use uncooked red onions sparingly To soften the taste chill raw onions in ice water for 20 minutes before serving For recipes using red onions click here Sweet onions Alternate names Fresh onion spring onion summer onionPictured top to bottom Bermuda VidaliaCharacteristics These storage onions are sweet because they have a lower concentration of sulfur allowing the sugar content to stand out People who like onions but dislike the strong taste will find sweet onions a good alternative Some people even consume them raw like ripe fruit Besides Vidalia and Bermuda whose name refers to a time when most onions imported to the U S were grown in Bermuda other well known sweet varieties grown primarily in parts of the South Southwest and Northwest United States include Walla Walla Maui Sweet Imperial and Texas Spring Sweet These don t keep as well as other storage onions so try to use them up as soon as possible For recipes using sweet onions click here Ramps Alternate names Tennessee truffles wild leek ramson wild leek ail des boisCharacteristics This North American native spring onion is edible in its entirety from the tops of its lily of the valley like leaves and stems all the way down to the bulb Eaten raw a ramp tastes strong and more like garlic than scallion but if cooked its flavor turns mildly sweet When serving try to keep the entire plant intact for a lovely presentation For recipes using ramps click here Scallions Alternate names Green onion bunching onion Chinese onion Welsh onionCharacteristics This spring onion s flavorful bite makes it a popular ingredient in Asian cooking as exemplified in the classic Korean Seafood Pancake Some recipes may specify using only the long green hollow leaves or the white bulbous ends but the scallion is entirely edible Recipes usually require that scallions be chopped Scallions are interchangeable with ramps Don t let them languish in the fridge use soon after purchase For recipes using scallions click here Cipollini Alternate names Cipollini onion Italian pearl onionCharacteristics This Italian onion doesn t look like cousins thanks to its flat top and squat shape but it is growing in popularity and availability in the U S Its taste is less acrid than that of its relatives making it ideal for creamed or glazed onions And because of the cipollinis size and shape they re easy to cook and serve whole Try them roasted or grilled on skewers For recipes using cipolline click here read a visual guide to cooking

long way within the past two centuries but sometimes accidents illnesses and deformities can confound even the most educated and experienced doctor The following list contains ten of the most famous medical miracles performed by doctors and perhaps by the patient s own will to survive These miracles consisted of a willingness on the part of doctors patients and parents to consent to medical treatment in an otherwise unbearable or fatal situation In most cases the miracles seem most obvious on the front end when patients survive or have overcome odds against living a normal life In all cases however the patients plights and the medical remedies have altered those patients lives forever Only time will tell if these patients continue to live a healthy if not totally normal life Survives Orthopedic Decapitation Doctors gave nine year old Jordan Taylor a one percent chance of survival after his skull was lifted from his vertebrae in an automobile accident Dr Richard Roberts connected Jordan s head with metal plates screws and rods and three months later Jordan returned to school He can walk and talk This is a medical miracle considering the extent of his injuries Survived Without Heart for 118 Days Fourteen year old D Zhana Simmons needed a new heart but the wait was longer than her current heart could bear Doctors including Dr Si Pham removed her heart and kept her alive for four months with two heart transplants that involved heart pumps During that time D Zhana said she felt like a fake person but is grateful for her new heart and for the ability to keep her alive during the waiting process Stabbed in Head and Survived Michael Hill now holds the Guinness World Book of Records title for Largest Object Removed From Human Skull but he probably wishes he never had to go that route Hill answered a friend s door in Jacksonville Florida and was stabbed in the head with a 20 cm 8 in survival knife on April 25 1998 Hill walked to another friend s house and they took him to Shands jacksonville Trauma Center Four hours after he arrived the knife was removed While he survived the wound caused permanent damage to his memory and paralyzed his left hand Man Cut in Half Survives and Now Walks Peng Shulin s body was cut in half by a lorry in 1995 Although it was a miracle that he survived he was chained to a bed for years as he developed skills to build up his arm muscles Recently doctors at the China Rehabilitation Research Centre in Beijing learned about Peng s plight and devised a way for him to walk on his own again The device is an egg like casing with two bionic legs attached Girl Survives Removal of Two Legs Two Arms Lakshmi Tatma was born attached to a headless identical twin sister a rare case that left Lakshmi unable to crawl or walk But she had one complete body with a near perfect set of organs so Dr Sharan Patil led a surgery team into one of the most complicated surgeries ever conducted to remove two year old Lakshmi s extra limbs and organs The surgery was successful which allows Lakshmi now to live a normal and hopefully long life Leaky Brain Fixed with Glue Ella Grace Honeyman was born with Vein of Galen malformation which causes tiny holes in brain blood vessels The seventeen month old girl was given just weeks to live when her parents hired a team of pioneering U S surgeons Those surgeons fired organic glue into the artery holes to plug them While the doctors saved her life the operations may be ongoing in a process to fix any new leaks This disease affects about 250 people in the world A Tooth for an Eye Martin Jones lose his left eye and was blinded in the right eye when a tub of molten aluminum exploded in his face twelve years ago Then he allowed surgeon Christopher Lui and his team to pull a canine from his mouth attach a tiny optical lens to that tooth and then implant the tooth into his eye socket The process took about four months but Martin can see again through that one eye And he seems to relish the shock that his eye gives to onlookers it s a bit spooky but serviceable Man Awakens After 20 Year Sleep In 1983 Terry Wallis suffered a severe brain injury in a car accident Twenty years later he emerged from what doctors call a minimally conscious state which is somewhere between being awake and being in a vegetative state Doctors now believe that Terry s brain built new pathways during those two decades that allowed him to become fully conscious and began to talk However he lost the ability to store new memories and he maintains physical disabilities from the original accident Electrodes Stimulate Dead Brain A patient was unable to communicate swallow or make coordinated physical movements for almost six years after he was seriously assaulted now can speak eat and laugh Doctors implanted electrodes into that man s brain using a stimulation technique already used on patients with Parkinson s disease A patient who receives this type of treatment and if it is appropriate to the case may receive immediate results Cured by a Spider Bite David Blancarte almost was killed in a motorcycle accident about two decades ago he survived but has been confined to a wheelchair Then he was bitten by a Brown Recluse spider a bite that sent him to a hospital for eight months But during that time he began to feel his legs and within five days David was walking again He may need to learn how to run however as he was arrested earlier this year for an outstanding warrant stemming from a domestic abuse case Did you enjoy this article "",""url"":""onlinebsn org

Sunday meal for Saturday night carousers While others suggest it was an early 20th century New York reporter allegedly speaking of the typical mid day eating habits of a newspaper reporter In my Midwestern upbringing brunch was done on Sundays It usually occurred with family and or friends after church and involved a massive spread of mouth watering entr\u00e9es As Scottsdale and Phoenix are both significant tourist destinations we thought it would be fun to compile the top 10 Sunday brunches in Scottsdale and Phoenix For days Carol scoured Google to find newspaper articles blogs magazine articles and even a little word of mouth to compile our list We then set ourselves upon the arduous task somebody s gotta do it of personally experiencing each and every one of our choices Nearly 100 mouthwatering photographs of Scottsdale and Phoenix Sunday brunches First off we decided that this wasn t going to be a this one s better than that one type of deal but rather a comprehensive sharing of ten very different Sunday brunch experiences Furthermore our Sunday brunches are listed in no particular order They are merely presented in the order that we experienced them We are a website that loves to share experiences and below you will find a great many photographs of some of the most tantalizing food known to man We sampled items like traditional Scottish haggis blue corn pancakes with

for life Originally the term detox diet was used in the treatment of people who had become dependent on drugs and alcohol With the growing awareness of alternative medicines for healing the body and the development of various kinds of weight loss diets the term is used for any cleansing diet that helps in detoxifying the body A body Cleansing Diet is done over a short term and involves a change in eating and drinking habits in an attempt to detoxify the body by getting rid of toxins or other contaminants A popular side effect or benefit is weight loss but many people claim an improvement in overall health The most common benefits being increased energy improved immune system and resistance to disease improved mental clarity and better digestion Why do a Detox Diet Few of us have systems that are well balanced because of the lifestyles we live We don t eat healthy food and we dont get enough rest or exercise So our bodies dont function as smoothly as they should We are exposed daily to pollutants and toxins Some from our environment and others are internal toxins produced as the byproduct of our digestive and metabolic processes Toxic and unwanted inorgranic chemicals are found in our foods water and air in the form of fertilizers pesticides heavy metals and other pollutants At home and at work we are exposed to all sorts of airborne micro organisms and debris paint and carpet fumes Everything from plastic containers to dry cleaned clothes to skin and haircare products and cosmetics bombard our bodies with unwanted pollutants All of these fall in the category of environmental toxins Our bodies also produce toxins through normal digestion and metabolism If your body has the proper nutrition in sufficient quantities to provide a healthy biochemistry and if the organs of elimination and detoxification are functioning at optimal levels your body is able to naturally eliminate these toxins safely and efficiently through cellular processes via the main organs of detoxification skin bowels liver kidneys and lungs This manifests as elimination through perspiration bowel elimination urination and respiration However if the body is producing and taking in more toxins than it can safely eliminate a state of chronic toxicity may occur Cleansing diets are designed to help your body rid itself of the toxic matter build up and lose weight If you feel sluggish have frequent colds digestive problems or just arent feeling your best you may have a toxicity issue A detox diet will help you clean the harmful matter from your body and lose weight Choosing a Cleansing Diet Detoxification is a process and can be a gentle cleansing ora more rigorous therapy where many foods are completelyavoided over a long period of time The detoxifying program you would choose would depend for themost part on the condition of your elimination system and yourover all health The good news is that you are not stuck with fasting as the only method of cleansing your body In fact it s now beleived that the liver is unable to cope with a full fast because the pollution of our food and environment is so bad Fasting can release too many toxins into the bloodstream at once so a gentler cleansing program may be a better option It s also more likely that you ll stick to a less stringent detoxification program Master Cleanse Diet Secrets Popular Detoxification Diets include Colon cleansing diets liquid cleansing diets and liver cleanse diets Liver and colon detoxes are growing in popularity as more consumers learn to avoid illness through proper prevention measures such as intestinal cleaning and detoxification In 1985 between 60 and 70 million Americans were affected by digestive disorders Today it s close to 100 million Colorectal cancer one of the

obsession with sugar salt and fat our obsession with sugar, salt and fat - cnn.com our obsession with sugar, salt and fat"",""body"":""Did you know that the food industry has created different kinds of salt to fit their specific products STORY HIGHLIGHTS Average American eats 33 pounds of cheese and 70 pounds of sugar a year The optimum amount of sugar in a product is known as the bliss point Food industry is hooked on salt author says as a miracle ingredient to solve problems Expert says it s more difficult for people to control their eating habits than narcotics TIME com In his new book Salt Sugar Fat Pulitzer Prize winning investigative reporter Michael Moss takes readers on a tour of the 1 trillion processed food industry and the sights aren t pretty The average American eats 33 pounds of cheese and 70 pounds of sugar a year and health experts say those trends triggered the obesity epidemic that has left millions at risk of heart disease diabetes and other chronic health conditions Based on his interviews with top industry executives from Kraft to Coca Cola as well as leading food scientists Moss discusses how we became so dependent on processed food How does covering the food industry compare to your other investigative reporting projects In some ways the food companies are fortresses They share so little of what they do with nosy reporters At the same time I kind of discovered that food companies are in some ways are like hotels When you really start meeting the people inside who work there there are few precious secrets People really do love to talk about their work I was also incredibly fortunate to come across thousands and thousands of pages of internal documents that shed huge light on the dark corners in the processed food industry and convinced some of the key executives to talk me It s pretty widely known that sugary cereals and Cheese Whiz are not good for you What surprised you One of the things that really surprised me was how concerted and targeted the effort is by food companies to hit the magical formulation Take sugar for example The optimum amount of sugar in a product became known as the bliss point Food inventors and scientists spend a huge amount of time formulating the perfect amount of sugar that will send us over the moon and send products flying off the shelves It is the process they ve engineered that struck me as really stunning When it came to fat it was the amazing role of what the industry calls the mouth feel That s the warm gooey taste of cheese or the bite into a crisp fried chicken that you get It rushes right to the same pleasure centers of the brain that sugar does but fat is carrying twice as many calories so it is more problematic from an obesity standpoint There is almost no limit to the bliss point in fat If there is one it s up in heavy cream some place So the companies discovered they could add as much fat as they wanted to products and unless people looked closely at the nutrition facts they are going to totally love it more than they would without the fat When it comes to salt what was really staggering to me is that the industry itself is totally hooked on salt It is this miracle ingredient that solves all of their problems There is the flavor burst to the salt itself but it also serves as a preservative so foods can stay on the shelves for months It also masks a lot of the off notes in flavors that are inherent to processed foods TIME com Why are Americans still obese After all your research do you believe these foods can be considered addictive That is the one single word that the food industry hates addiction They much prefer words like crave ability and allure Some of the top scientists who are very knowledgeable about addiction in the country are very convinced that for some people the most highly sugared high fat foods are every bit as addictive as some narcotics Their advice to these people is don t try to eat just a couple Oreo cookies because you are not going to be able to stop Sugar uses the same neurological pathways as narcotic products rely on to hit the pleasure center of the brain that send out the signals eat more eat more That said the food industry defends itself by saying true narcotic addiction has certain technical thresholds that you just don t find in food addiction It s true but in some ways getting unhooked on foods is harder than getting unhooked on narcotics because you can t go cold turkey You can t just stop eating The head of the National Institute on Drug Abuse in Washington says that it s more difficult for people to control their eating habits than narcotics She is hugely empathic with overeaters In your book you talk about how the industry fiddles with the physical shapes of ingredients like fat and salt so they taste better on the tongue How are companies using this process Cargill among other companies make numerous versions of salt to meet the particular needs of their customers and their products I had this vision of salt as chunks coming out of the ground and then thrown into a box But in fact they re manipulated to work perfectly with every special product There are powdered salts chunked salts salts shaped in different ways with various additives to work perfectly with processed foods All of them are geared to increase allure My favorite is the one called the kosher salt It looks like snow but is shaped like a pyramid with flat sides that enable it to stick to food better But where the magic comes in is that it s hollowed out so your saliva has more contact with the salt Your saliva is what conveys the salt taste to the taste buds which send the electric signals to your brain The kosher salt also dissolves three times as fast as regular salt so you re getting a much larger hit of what the companies call the flavor burst I thought that was truly fascinating You focus heavily on the success of Lunchables to appeal to kids What fascinated you about their creation Lunchables was an incredible stroke of marketing genius Especially when they came up with the idea of making pizza Lunchables They asked mothers whether they thought their kids would eat this cold pizza that they assembled themselves and the mothers said Are you kidding me That sounds so awful But when they turned to the kids and asked Hey what do you guys think the kids said Yeah That sounds really interesting They realized that the overwhelming attraction to the Lunchables wasn t the taste It s the empowerment It s about letting kids have control and manipulate what they re eating They came up with this brilliant Lunchable slogan which was All day you have to do what they say but lunch time is all yours That resonated deeply with children and sales just went through the roof The darker side of Lunchables is that it brought fast food into the grocery store which has become a real concern given the obesity crisis The CDC put out a recent report saying consumption of fast food has declined from 13 of our calories to 11 There is some reason to believe that it was due to the recession because people were trying to cut back on going out to eat The question is what are they substituting for that fast food If you look at grocery stores in the last decade or more there s been an increase in foods that try and emulate fast foods It s like the industry has moved into the grocery store TIME com Cutting soda curbs children s weight gain Were you surprised by how many scientists and food company executives avoid their own products It was everything from a former top scientist at Kraft saying he used to maintain his weight by jogging and then he blew out his knee and couldn t exercise his solution was to avoid sugar and all caloric drinks including all the Kool Aid and sugary drinks that Kraft makes It ranged from him to the former top scientist at Frito Lay I spent days at his house going over documents relating to his efforts at Frito Lay to push the company to cut back on salt He served me plain cooked oatmeal and raw asparagus for lunch We toured his kitchen and he did not have one single processed food product in his cupboards or refrigerator The scientists and executives were pretty honest about their roles in creating unhealthy food Did you get the impression they felt guilty about their products One reason they don t eat their own products is that they know better They know about the addictive properties of sugar salt and fat As insiders they know too much I think a lot of them have come to feel badly But not blaming themselves necessarily because the older ones invented a number of these products back in the days when dependency on them was much lower In the 70s and the 80s for example we were eating more home cooked meals from scratch and eating more mindfully As society evolved and we became more dependent on these conveniences these people came to see their work with real misgivings The inventor of the Lunchables Bob Drane wishes mightily that the nutritional aspects of that product could ve been made better He is still hoping it will be made better They came to have regrets about their work in the context of the health effects their products seem to have that go hand in hand with society s increasing demand of their products You highlight some examples of companies trying to make their food healthier Are there any changes you find particularly positive I was really struck by the concerted effort by Kraft to embrace an anti obesity initiative At first they tried to rally the whole industry to collectively cut back and try to fight obesity including down formulating the amount of salt sugar and fats they were using But when that failed and the rest of the companies refused to join Kraft set off on its own It cut back on its marketing of sugary products to children and rejiggered it s packaging so it would tell people how much salt sugar and fat in calories were in each package not just in a tiny little serving The most revolutionary thing was that they ordered their food scientists to limit the salt sugar and fat in their products This was a company where every ounce of their effort for decades and decades had gone into making products as hugely appealing and addictive as possible Mind you these are not companies that want people to get fat or unhealthy that s not in their business interests but they do want people to buy as much of their products as they possibly can To have Kraft then say to itself Wait a minute maybe there s some other competing interest to pay attention to was mind blowing Ultimately they ran into the problem that the whole industry faces which is the huge pressure from Wall Street and the investment community to increase profits TIME com The 31 healthiest foods of all time What do you think is the greatest obstacle standing in the way of federal regulation of salt sugar and fat I think the USDA is badly conflicted It has multiple missions and one of the biggest is to support the agricultural industry This plays out most significantly in the area of cheese and beef The USDA has become a partner with the dairy industry and the beef industry in promoting increased consumption of cheese and red meat at a time when its own nutritionists are encouraging people to cut back because both are heavily laden with saturated fat which is linked to heart disease This largely explains why cheese consumption has tripled in this country since the 70s to as much as 33 pounds per person per year On the flipside the USDA has this tiny little operation that creates things like the food pyramid and dietary guidelines to encourage people to limit their consumption of saturated fat but the budget for those efforts is miniscule compared to budget for promoting consumption One of the key things for moving forward is that the playing field needs to be leveled in terms of pricing We all know we should be eating more fresh vegetables and fresh fruits When you hit that part of the store and you see that blueberries cost 5 for a little basket and you can wheel over to the center of the store and see all these power bars and seemingly healthy things that are in fact loaded with salt sugar and fat and they are half the price or a third the price and there are all these other things that can fill up your cart for much less money That s a really difficult thing for families to deal with Everyone is convinced that the government subsidies that support processed food need to be shifted over in some way to fresh fruits and vegetables or it s going to continue to be hard for even people who want to eat better to do so financially Do you think there s any change in sight I think we are at a real tipping point here What I hear from people inside the food industry is that the food giants are scared to death right now The pressure from Wall Street on profits has never been greater The pressure from consumers for better healthier products has never been greater The pressure from the White House to do something to fight obesity is increasing The other problem they re having is that they ve cut way back on the pure science and research that they used to do and so many of the scientists I ve talked to are pleading with these companies to start putting more money into inventing new products that both taste good and are healthy I think that will be key to getting out of this mess we are in Have any of your eating and purchasing habits changed since writing this I have two boys age 8 and 13 and it certainly makes things difficult My wife like so many people works outside the home like I do and our mornings are totally crazy That said we ve been working on breakfast We get the boys to eat 100 whole wheat toast and they really don t notice the difference between white bread and wheat We arbitrarily set a limit on cereals of 5g of sugar per serving which they find kind of fun because they can go into the cereal aisles and hunt for cereals that have that much sugar or less They may have to reach low or reach high to find them because they re not at eye level but basic Cherrios have one gram per serving which is fantastic and they love it If you engage kids in the process of getting healthier they rise to the occasion They are smart and they re eager TIME com Make over your diet in one week Do you have any advice for people going into the grocery store who want to eat healthier Make a list and stick to it Some of the plotting done by grocery stores and food manufacturers is to get you into situations where you are making spontaneous decisions That s when the soda and the sugary foods around the check counter get sold most heavily Spend more time on the ends of the supermarket near the fresh vegetable and fresh fruit aisle and look for things that are affordable When you get into the center aisle be careful in the middle part because that s the highest selling area and where they put the most heavily laden salt and sugary products Also look first at the front of the packaging That s where they hit you with things like low fat and low sugar and added calcium and vitamin this and vitamin that Take those as warning signs When they say low fat it s often loaded with sugar to make up for the reduction in fat Or likewise low salt is often loaded with sugar and fat to make up for the low salt When they splash the phrase added calcium on the front that s often a signal that the thing is loaded in all three of the pillars Lastly spend some time with the nutrition facts box It has to be on every package now It can be really revealing as to what exactly is in the package Pay attention to the number of servings per container because the companies know that people will typically eat a package of cookies that has three servings in it all at once You have to do the math yourself because they will list the nutrient content based on one serving which will dramatically understate the amount of nutrient load you re getting by eating the package Very few of us can avoid processed foods all together Our lives will not allow it I m certainly in that category But ultimately we are the ones who decide what to buy what to eat and how much to eat and that s a very powerful thing when we walk into the grocery store I hope the book can help people to understand everything the food giants are throwing at you in terms of formulating marketing and advertising I think you come away feeling more empowered to take control of that decision making process yourself

Blumenfeld Getty Images He fakes to the left passes to the right and then oh wait what is he doing Did he just jump over that guy like a hurdle Trick plays like these are what many sports fans live for They only happen on rare occasions but when they do and they are successful they leave the other team fans and even some of their own teammates staring Here is a list of 25 of the best trick plays in sports No 25 South Carolina Tricks Kentucky with Secret Pass Off This is a great trick play South Carolina passes off the ball several times keeping it from being seen by Kentucky and keeping the Wildcats guessing where the ball is while another one of its players runs down the field to get in position to catch and score No 24 Isolation by the Redskins In this move the Washington Redskins create an isolation to give their players time and space to make the touchdown While the maneuver didn t work this particular time it was still obviously a little confusing and surprising for the other team No 23 Team Catches Opponent Off Guard In this trick play the team in white seems to catch the team in black off guard with their only half ready appearance on the field which gives one player the chance to run down the field while their quarterback can set up the pass without being worried about being tackled No 22 Keep Away In this classic baseball trick play a member of the team in the infield pretends to throw the ball back to the pitcher but actually keeps the ball When the runner thinks he s safe and begins to lean away from the base the infielder still with the ball runs up and tags him out Classic trickery on this team s part No 21 Alabama Makes Fake Run Against Arkansas In this awesome trick play an Alabama player secretly hands off the ball to a teammate behind him but continues to run down the field as if he has the ball and is going for the touchdown While the rest of the Arkansas team chases down the player they think has the ball the guy actually with the ball sets up a beautiful pass and throws it to another open teammate down the field allowing Alabama to score No 20 Pretend Trip Up and Loss of Ball In this quick little soccer play the player with the ball pretends to trip over the ball as he is dribbling but really kicks it between the legs of the two guys defending him setting himself up to take the shot and score on goal No 19 The Pop and Roll In this beautiful trick play Bethel College s quarterback pops the ball up and back behind himself to one of his receivers who is then able to keep himself upright just enough to score No 18 Cleveland Browns Secret Handoff In a series of confusing and lightning fast handoffs the Cleveland Browns are able to conceal the whereabouts of the ball and run the ball down the field and score No 17 The Fake Field Goal In this classic trick play LSU fakes a field goal and then runs in for the touchdown No 16 Fake Lacrosse Pass Off Similar to the classic hidden ball trick in baseball in this trick play a player pops the ball up as if he s passing it off to a teammate but in all actuality still has possession of the ball He s then able to score while everyone else is looking the other way Very sneaky No 15 Pretend Fumble and Recover The Patriots fake a fumble to distract their opponents and when one of their teammates has had a chance to run up the field and get open they recover it and pass for the score No 14 Ole Miss Secret Handoff Ole Miss pulls one of the greatest secret pass offs of all time in this play At the beginning of the play they hike the ball to one player who then immediately while still crouched down hands it off to another and then runs like he still has the ball The guy actually with the ball is then able to easily set up and execute a run earning Ole Miss a touchdown No 13 The Fake Throw In this trick play the pitcher pretends to throw to his teammate guarding the base and when everyone runs for the ball that wasn t actually thrown the pitcher runs after and tags out the player on that base No 12 Hidden Ball Lacrosse Trick This may be one of the greatest fake passing runs ever to be played in lacrosse In this play Boston creates a fake handoff tricking the goalie and allowing it to scoreThe play was so smooth and secretive that the other team didn t even seem to know that the other player didn t actually have the ball No 11 Is There Something Wrong with the Ball Is there something wrong with the ball coach Nope that s just a ploy this team used to trick its opponent into inaction in this play No 10 Cleveland Browns Secret Pass and Score Here is another amazing trick play from the Cleveland Browns In this one the Browns pass it off shortly and secretly several times to keep the other team guessing where the ball has gone While they re doing this Brian Robiskie runs down the field and gets open to catch the pass and score a touchdown No 9 UC Irvine Gets LSU with Hidden Ball Trick In this amazing trick play a player from UC Irvine knows he has no hope of getting the ball to third base before an LSU player touches it so he fakes a throw to the base After the fake he ran up and tagged the runner at second base it was so convincing and well done that the umpire called the LSU player out actually believing he was tagged out even though it was late No 8 Presbyterian College Trick Play Against Wake Forest This is what I would like to call a bounce pass and no it isn t a basketball trick It s actually a football trick In this play one player bounces the ball across the field to his teammate making the other team believe there has been an incomplete pass But the ball is actually recovered and while all of that distraction was going on another player got into the perfect position to catch the still live ball and score a touchdown No 7 Fake Catch and Throw In this foreign baseball game an outfielder pretends to catch what was nearly a home run and then proceeds to throw the ball back to the infield keeping the runners from advancing as far as they could have No 6 Left Fake This dodge is so effective and convincing that the player is able to shake off all defenders and run the ball for 98 yards down the field No 5 The Fake Pass Around This is the greatest trick lacrosse play ever In it one team pretends to pass the ball around and around but in all actuality only one player keeps the ball in his pocket Then when the other team is thoroughly confused about where the ball actually is they go for the score No 4 Fake Punt and Touchdown Here is an great example of how effective the fake punt can be In this clip the team running the play was actually able to score a touchdown off the fake No 3 Wrong Ball Play This is one hilarious and amazing trick play Here the maroon team fakes like the ball it has is not the game ball and then hands the ball off to the quarterback While the other team is confused about why the ball isn t the right one the quarterback runs down the field and scores No 2 Pretend Fall This is one tricky and potentially dangerous trick play One player approaching the ball pretends to fall while another player comes up from behind and then steals the ball from his fallen teammate creating confusion about who really has the ball on the field I wonder how many people have gotten kicked or hit in the head with the ball in this play No 1 The Walk Up This is by far the greatest trick play ever to have been used legally in a game Here the quarterback is gently handed the ball and begins to just walk forward while the rest of his team stays in starting position making it look like the play hasn t started yet which causes the other team not to move either Once the quarterback has cleared the defensive line he takes off running full sprint and scores with no one in his way to stop him rankings\/list, multiple sports, sfgate, seattlepi, latimes, philly lists, cool lists, chron lists, national lists and rankings, flagship he fakes to the left, passes to the

liquid nitrogen in removing warts After two months of wearing duct tape on a daily basis and using a pumice stone about once a week to exfoliate the dead skin 85 percent of patients warts were gone whereas freezing only removed 60 percent The question is whether there is something in the chemical adhesive itself or if the occlusion suffocation causes the destruction of the wart says New York

menthol in the balm that kills the fungus and others say it s the smothering effect of the thick gel if used consistently vapor rub has been shown to get rid of not just the fungus but the infected toenail too which will turn black and eventually fall off When the new nail grows in it should be fungus free Photo Thinkstock Oatmeal to Soothe Eczema This is absolutely true as oats have anti inflammatory properties Dr Blum says Whether it s used as a paste or poured into a bath most experts recommend choosing colloidal finely ground oatmeal and soaking the affected area for at least 15 minutes In addition to reducing inflammation oats are thought to have an antihistamine effect Dr Blum says By lowering levels of histamine which triggers inflammation as part of the immune system s recovery response she explains oats prevent or reduce the redness Photo Thinkstock Yogurt to Cure Bad Breath Bad breath comes from a number of places the two most common being the mouth and the stomach The neutralizing powers of yogurt and other probiotics treat the latter cause Yogurt shouldn t have any effect at all on the bacteria that live on the tongue because it s not there long enough says Robert Meltzer MD a New York City based gastroenterologist and attending physician at Lenox Hill Hospital However it likely has a neutralizing effect on the acid that resides anywhere between the mouth and the stomach including the back of the throat and the esophagus he explains I think almost any milk product or food that contains live cultures would have the same effect While yogurt can get rid of bad breath that results from gastrological conditions like acid reflux it won t have any real effect on bad breath that is the product of gum liver or lung disease says Ohio based dentist Matthew Messina DDS Photo Thinkstock A Spoonful of Sugar to Cure Hiccups In 1971 Edgar Engelman MD conducted a study to find out if a spoonful of sugar really is an effective cure for hiccups He assembled a group of 20 patients who had been experiencing intractable hiccups for more than six hours eight of whom had had them anywhere from a full day to six weeks Each of the test subjects was given one teaspoon of white granulated sugar to swallow dry and for 19 of the 20 hiccup patients the cure was immediate Andr\u00e9 Dubois MD a gastroenterologist in Bethesda Maryland noted in The Doctors Book of Home Remedies that the sugar is probably acting in the mouth to modify the nervous impulses that would otherwise tell the muscles in the diaphragm to contract spasmodically Photo iStockphoto Bite a Pencil to Cure a Headache While doctors aren t sure why we do it clenching our teeth is a common side effect of stress According to Fred Sheftell MD director of the New England Center for Headache in Stamford Connecticut when we clench up we strain the muscle that connects the jaw to the temples which can trigger a tension headache By placing a pencil between our teeth but not biting down we relax our jaw muscles which eradicates tension and reduces pain Just remember the remedy really only applies to tension headaches not migraines or headaches caused by sinus pressure etc Photo Thinkstock Olives for Motion Sickness According to the National Library of Medicine there are a number of symptoms that present themselves as a result of motion sickness including increased salivation which is the body s way of protecting the teeth from the high doses of acid accompanied by vomit Enter olives which contain tannins that when released in the mouth work to dry saliva first eliminating the symptom and then the body s instinct to follow suit However the treatment is only effective during the early stages of nausea when the salivation changes first appear Photo Thinkstock Gargle Salt Water for a Sore Throat When you were a kid and had a sore throat your mom likely made you gargle warm water with salt in it and she was definitely on to something According to Douglas Hoffman MD PhD author of the website The Medical Consumer s Advocate a sore throat is an inflammatory response of the infected tissues and the salt helps draw out the excess fluid to temporarily decrease swelling and the pain it causes Most remedies call for a ratio of 1 tablespoon salt to 8 ounces of water but it s always better to opt for more salt rather than less Just keep in mind that you are treating the symptoms not the illness As Dr Hoffman notes on his website The relief is very real but also tends to be short lived since the gargle has done nothing to remove the cause of the sore throat Photo Thinkstock health tips and home remedies that work at womansday.com alternative medicine, health tips health tips and home remedies that work at womansday.com"",""url"":""womansday

leading her kingdom she s instead baking this Who could blame her The Queen of Hearts certainly gets a lot of attention Songs nursery rhymes and Disney villains are centered on her royal presence It might be because she s the monarch of the most tender of suits It might be her circus freak appearance what with her lower torso being a twin who was only half absorbed in the womb and both wearing matching robes and wimples Maybe her green thumb and affinity for tiny flowers But personally I think it s because we adore her fondness of tarts I submit the following evidence The Queen of Hearts she made some tarts all on a summer s day The Knave of Hearts he stole the tarts and took them clean away The King of Hearts called for the tarts and beat the Knave full soreThe Knave of Hearts brought back the tarts andvowed he d steal no more To have your hubby kick the heck out of a guy like he s an old soup can because he stole a tart I dare you to find a greater example of someone s love for good food Now obviously the Queen was being selfish Royalty or not she should share her tarts That s why the Knave stole them he was hungry and wanted a taste And really can you blame him I mean look at this tart Chocolate caramel more chocolate and salt What s not to love Who wouldn t steal a piece I would totally snag a slice of tart if it were just lying around but I d be smart to pack a tazer to take down kingy And if he wasn t around and I had to deal with the Queen proper well I doubt something like 5000 volts will take her down After all this is her tart we re talking about That s dedication you can appreciate Now you ve probably seen this particular tart around the Internet First on Saveur then on Lottie Doof and on Eating SF but now you re seeing it here This one is my tart Actually my first tart Ever In my desire to learn more about baking I ve been trying new things This tart is a perfect beginner s tart and though it might look daunting it isn t Furthermore avid tart bakers with more experience will appreciate how simply this tosses together for a real wow factor at any event enough to even impress a Queen The obligatory chocolate caramel tart shot Seriously go check If you do this recipe you have to take this particular photo It s one of the unsaid rules of food writing Chocolate Caramel TartThe crust for this recipe comes from Cindy Mushet s The Art and Soul of Baking and served me quite well The caramel is adapted from Lottie Doof The tart recipe as a whole is adapted from Saveur FOR THE CRUST 1 stick of unsalted butter softened1 2 cup of sugar1 large egg yolk1 cup all purpose flour2 1 2 tablespoons of Dutch processed cocoa powderFOR THE CARAMEL1 2 cup water2 cups granulated sugar1 4 cup light corn syrup1 2 cup heavy cream8 tablespoons of salted butter2 tablespoons sour creamFOR THE GANACHE1 2 cup heavy cream4 ounces extra bittersweet chocolate finely choppedSea salt or kosher salt for garnish1 Place butter and sugar in the bowl of a mixer and mix on medium for 3 minutes Scrape down the sides and add the egg yolk and beat well 2 In another bowl whisk together the flour and cocoa powder Add to the butter mixture all at once Then mix in at lowest speed until it just comes together it will have small and medium clumps Any more and it will become sticky and difficult to work with 3 Scrape dough into tart pan Press into the bottom of the tart and outward using the heel of your palm Use your fingers to pull the tart up the edge Chill for an hour in the fridge Reserve a little bit of dough to patch the shell later if necessary 4 Preheat the oven to 350F Bake tart shell for 15 minutes Check to see if the dough has cracked if so patch it with the reserved dough Bake for another 10 15 minutes keeping an eye on it to ensure it doesn t burn Cool on wire rack 5 Make the caramel In a saucepan whisk together sugar corn syrup and water and bring to a boil Cook over medium high heat until a medium dark amber color swirling occasionally Take off heat and add the cream butter and sour cream Stir together until smooth Pour into cooled tart shell and let cool to room temperature then place in the fridge to chill and set 6 Make the ganache Bring cream to a boil in a 1 qt saucepan over medium heat Put chocolate into a medium bowl and pour in hot cream let sit for 1 minute then stir slowly with a rubber spatula until smooth Pour ganache evenly over tart and refrigerate until set 4 5 hours Sprinkle tart with sea salt slice and serve chilled SERVES 8 10 I d totally smack a Knave if he pilfered this This post extolling the awesomness of this tart was actually written before I found out that Saveur had nominated me for one of their Best Food Blog Awards I ve been nominated amongst some other amazing bloggers for the category of Best Individual Post for the cheese profile on Devil s Gulch I do hope you ll all go and vote for me if you feel my post exemplifies the kind of writing you hope to see in

Bread Photo Tutorial "",""body"":""I may have mentioned no knead bread once or twice before My method has roots in the NYT The Minimalist recipe but I ve eliminated several steps over time and am still happy with the results This recipe is wonderful for people short on time or spoons It is a high water low yeast long rise recipe where time does the work of developing the gluten instead of your hands and muscles You do need a good cooking vessel and the strength to lift it in and out of the oven but otherwise the ingredient equipment and activity needs are fairly minimal My breadmaker languishes in the cupboard these days only dragged out if we want bread the same day or to make jam The texture is lovely a little bit sourdough a little bit Italian a little bit ciabatta You can adjust the texture and taste in a few ways this is what I ve settled on as my basic recipe but do please play with it I ve never made an effort to do this with any non wheat flours and I feel that this particular recipe is pretty much dependent on gluten but others have tried and tried and tried and some have made edible things People keep asking how I make it but as I don t measure particularly much and it s all done by feel and experience now I tend to wave my hands pointlessly in the air and generally fail at getting across how exactly I make this stuff So here s a photo tutorial Very image heavy below the cut I m sorry I haven t alt tagged and title tagged all the gazillion photos but I do describe the action in the post text Ingredients And Equipment You will need About three cups of flour I use one third wholemeal flour two thirds organic baker s flour high gluten I have made this before with regular plain flour and it still works fine Add more wholemeal if you like but you ll find your rise is much less enthusiastic About two teaspoons of salt About two cups of water About a third to a half a teaspoon of instant yeast A large bowl A mixing spoon A lidded cooking vessel that can take a very high heat Oven gauntlets A clean tea towel Optional ingredients include seeds poppy sesame caraway sunflower nigella whatever else you like orange juice olive oil herbs nuts etc Also handy A dough scraper but you can use a spoon if you really want to I use these gorgeous gauntlets They are very heavy duty and have silicone grips for extra grippiness and extra heat resistance This pot will be HOT And heavy This is my bread pot It s an oval Le Creuset dutch oven Be sure to cover the handle liberally with aluminium foil if you don t it will smoke and burn and smell really really bad Other people have used lidded Pyrex risky some say yes some say no various heatproof lidded ceramic pots and so on I can t emphasis this too much your oven will be HOT Make sure your cooking vessel can take it You also want something with a good thermal mass not a thin metal pan I recommend cast iron either enamelled or not Making the dough First step Measure out your flour I use whatever coffee cup comes to hand and I throw in around one cup of wholemeal flour and two cups of white I don t shake or level or anything else fancy I just scoop and throw You ll adjust the texture in the water step Make sure your bowl is quite a bit bigger than your mix You will get a lot of rising later maybe double or triple the size of the stuff Or sometimes more Yeast About a third of a teaspoon for a long rise overnight you can speed up the rise a bit by adding more yeast and mixing with warm water but you will sacrifice texture and taste if you do this I use a table teaspoon not a measuring spoon Salt Two heaped teaspoons Yes it needs salt I left it out once and BLEAGH Also the salt helps preserve the bread You can get all fancy and use expensive salt if you want I don t bother Mix up those dry ingredients You can add some poppy seeds or other bits n pieces now Now for the wet stuff You can optionally add around a capful or two of orange juice to make the yeasties extra happy Don t worry about it if you don t have this handy You can also add olive oil I do around 20 30 seconds of this dribbler which I think is something like a tablespoon or a dessertspoon or something in this order of magnitude It s no big deal if you leave this out but don t leave out the salt Really Top that cup up with tap water Chuck it in Grab another cup of tap water but don t put all of this in Put maybe a half or mmmaybe two thirds depending on how heapy you did the flour cups back at the start Mix it on up This is the part that I find hard to explain You need to adjust that water amount to get the texture right It should be wet too wet to tip out and knead but not as wet as cake batter It shouldn t look sort of dusty floury lThere still should be quite a bit of resistance to stirring not just la la la stir stir stir like you do when making a cake If you can scoop up a spoonful and it drops off the spoon really easily like this it s too wet When it s right it will strand a lot when you try to lift up a spoonful like this It will reluctantly drop off the spoon but strandily So go on adjusting that water level you may sometimes need to shake in a little more flour until it s just right You will get a feel for this over time Letting it rise Grab a clean tea towel wet it thoroughly squeeze it out don t wring and drape that over the bowl Some people cover with a lid or plastic wrap but I wasn t happy with the results when I did that I prefer this method Go ahead and leave this bowl somewhere non freezing overnight How long How long is a piece of string I usually mix it up in the evening and cook it around the middle of the day or in the afternoon the next day I ve left it 14 hours before I ve left it 24 Longer rises can have less yeast and a cooler spot shorter rises want a little more yeast and a warmer spot and if you re in a big hurry use tepidly warmish water to mix it up instead of taking it from the cold tap If it hasn t risen to your satisfaction you can pop it in an oven with only the light on for a while or set it on a heat pad or heated wheat bag Here s one I prepared earlier It isn t the hugest rise ever but it s just fine I can see lots of little bubbles over the surface which haven t shown up well in the picture Sometimes you ll see some big bubbles making themselves known I m confident this is going to be good there s a lovely yeasty smell Cooking Here s the inside of my pot You can see that it s very very well seasoned This pot has seen a lot of loaves of bread I don t use it for anything else these days and it never sees detergent just a wipe out after use If your pot isn t well seasoned I do recommend a spray or a smear of olive oil Some of my earlier batches stuck and that was all kinds of no fun at all Set your oven to 230 240 degrees For the Luddites that s around 445 465 Pop your pot in there making sure any Bakelite is well covered And preheat the oven and pot and lid for about 20 minutes When that pot is lovely and hot take it out carefully and dump that dough on in Try to get it quickly peeled out and dumped in one piece with as little stretching and separating and dropping and fiddling as you can I use a dough scraper to scoop and place In this picture I ve held the bowl up to show you the stranding all that gluten developed with no kneading The power of microbeasties This is how it should look now Don t stand around looking at it for too long Put on some seeds if you like I ve used sesame Lid on and put it in the oven for 20 minutes This recipe is so easy you don t even have to re set your timer to a different number At the twenty minute mark take the lid off I ve taken the pot out for the photo but usually I just reach in and grab the lid out for minimal heat loss Salivate now If your oven heats a little unevenly this might also be a good time to spin the pot around 180 degrees Another twenty minutes The Bread This is your finished product In the pot and out of it This is the underside And here it is cooling on the rack If you want a chewy crust and very moist crumb you can wrap it in a tea towel at this stage For a crustier crust leave it out in the open If you prefer something in between you can wrap it for a while and then unwrap it Look at this baby Do you love it IMPORTANT Do not cut it until it s cooled right down Yes I know how tempting it is Just wait It s worth it Tra la Serve However you like Spread it with butter Drizzle it with olive oil Try cream cheese Peanut butter Pesto Pate Make bruschetta Make garlic bread When the loaf is down to the last quarter and getting a tad stale slice the crusts off and use the interior to make stuffing for poultry I just cut it into cubes no fiddefaddling or toasting So to recap the numbers Three cups of flour two teaspoons of salt a third of a teaspoon of yeast but no one ll care if you put in a half Optional stuff OJ EVOO seeds etc Leave it for 18 hours or whatever Preheat to hot for 20 cook for 20 lid on 20 lid off Related Posts related posts: a good bread day by lauredhel soapmaking and breadmaking &#8211; will i be in demand when the pandemic comes? by lauredhel wednesday

thing On Wednesday I was kidnapped Yes it s true Right in the middle of class someone swooped in and transported me off to this alternate universe called Fourier space It was the land where everything I apparently did not learn in my college differential equations class went to die There were all sorts of weird symbols and these strange functions called transforms And just to give you an idea it s the type of place where it is convenient to write things as complex i e imaginary numbers Yeah that s totally a direct quote I m not quite sure what to make of it either Though from what I can tell the idea is that when you re looking at something through a microscope there are all of these weird transformations that happen in this imaginary number space and that s how you end up seeing the image that you see All this time I thought I was doing science When really It was sorcery Thankfully I escaped from this awful awful place And upon returning home I craved simplicity I craved second grade and learning how to write in cursive and thinking that long division was super ridiculously hard Actually it still is But as an adult you get to use a calculator I craved grilled cheese and tomato soup Because really what could be more simple Or delicious This is not your average elementary school Wonder bread American cheese sandwich with a can of Campbell s however No siree This is grilled cheese and tomato soup for those of us who have extra time now that we have calculators to do all the dirty work for us and don t have to worry about carrying numbers or where the decimal point goes Honey curry bread grilled cheddar cheese with a warm and spicy cashew tomato soup A Ma Zing The bread is sweet with a hint of spice from the curry powder the perfect compliment to a super sharp cheddar And the soup A revelation Also filled with curry esque spices it is so richly flavorful that you ll really have to stop yourself from drinking it out of the pot But really it s so good for you why bother The perfect comfort food after any traumatic graduate school class you may have experienced Or just because Does comfort ever really need a reason This week those of us cooking

gourmet emporium that used to reside on Manhattan s Upper West Side To see more of their recipes check out these blogs Honey Curry BreadMakes 1 loaf adapted from The Silver Palate Good Times CookbookIngredients1 4 cup warm water 1 tbsp yeast or 1 1 2 packages 1 1 2 tbsp unsalted butter 1 tbsp curry powder 1 3 cup honey 1 cup buttermilk 1 tsp salt 3 to 3 1 2 cups AP flour InstructionsMix the water and yeast in a small bowl Add a pinch of sugar and stir to mix Let sit for about five minutes or until it becomes foamy Meanwhile melt the butter in a small saucepan and stir in the curry powder Cook over low heat for 1 minute Stir in the honey and remove from heat In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large bowl combine the butter mixture yeast buttermilk salt and 3 cups flour If using a mixer use the hook attachment to combine adding enough flour to form a soft dough It should be enough so that after a minute or so of mixing the dough no longer sticks to the side of the bowl Mix for 5 minutes on high speed to knead or until smooth and elastic Place the dough in a greased bowl Cover with a damp towel and let rise until doubled about 2 hours Punch the dough down Shape into a standard loaf and place in a loaf tin Cover and let rise for 45 minutes Preheat oven to 375 Bake until loaf is browned and sounds hollow when lightly thumped about 40 45 minutes Cool on wire rack to room temperature Warm and Spicy Cashew and Tomato SoupServes 4 adapted from Daily Unadventures in Cooking Ingredients1 1 2 lb tomatoes I used 1 lb kumato and 1 2 lb plum 2 tsp olive oil salt as necessary 1 small onion sliced 4 cloves garlic minced 1 tsp roughly chopped ginger 1 tsp garam masala 1 tsp ground coriander 1 4 tsp chipotle chili powder 1 4 cup salted cashews 1 tbsp tomato paste 1 1 piece of cinnamon stick 1 cardamom pod bruised 4 cups water 1 3 cup nonfat greek yogurt InstructionsPreheat oven to 300 Cut the tomatoes in half lengthwise gently tossing with 1 tsp of the oil Sprinkle with salt Lay the tomatoes on a baking sheet lined with foil cut side up Bake for an hour or longer if you have the time Meanwhile in a large pot brown the onion in the remaining oil until it is a nice even golden brown Cook on medium and stir often Once browned add the garlic ginger garam masala coriander chili powder cashews and tomato paste Cook for a few minutes until nice and fragrant stirring often Add cinnamon cardamom pod and water making sure to scrape the bottom of the pot and get up any browned bits When the tomatoes are finished roasting add them to the soup and stir Simmer gently for 30 minutes Remove the cinnamon stick and cardamom pod if you can find it I just left mine in Using an immersion blender blend thoroughly In a small bowl slowly whisk a few tbsp of soup into the yogurt This will help to thin it and allow it to emulsify better into the soup When thinned out stir back into the soup over low heat Season to taste with salt Serve hot Preferably with grilled

differently - how we make certain - forbes"",""body"":""Recently there was a great post by Dr Ken Murray titled Why Doctors Die Differently Dr Murray eloquently discusses the decisions physicians make for themselves at the end of life and our hesitation in bestowing our views on the vulnerable He ends with a story of his non physician cousin choosing the non aggressive path after a cancer diagnosis illustrating that more people can make this choice In the Twittersphere there has been much discussion about this article Matthew Herper a wonderful journalist for Forbes and a man who likes his data has stated I still want to see real data on whether doctors actually do die differently than everybody else The original post by Dr Murray didn t have reference to data although the subsequent article in the WSJ did cite that physicians are more likely to have advance directives To do a study on whether physicians die differently wouldn t be controlled pass an ethics committee or it would be picketed by the No you can t go peacefully in the night coalition However I can provide a small informal study of the clients in my financial planning practice most of whom are physicians In my practice not only do doctors plan to die differently their families die differently also One requirement of becoming a client in our practice is the desire to address all parts of a financial life plan which includes end of life planning Age marital status fear of death or body habitus does not matter we all die and our firm helps people prepare for that event in advance in a kind and loving way When discussing health care directives most people focus on the actions that occur at the end of life and not the desired outcome For example Do you want to be hooked to life support My favorite Do you want CPR which for the most part doesn t work at the end of life will crush the bones in your chest and when all is said and done will be just another charge on the superbill the hospital sends to the insurance company after your death A better approach is to focus on the desired outcome If you are ill what type of lifestyle is acceptable to you I had one client who said As long as I can use my brain even if I can t move I want to be kept going To translate this into medical terms she was okay being a quadriplegic but wouldn t want to be kept alive if she was in a persistent vegetative state Talking about how we want to be instead of what we want to have happen allows the family and health care providers to decide on the appropriate treatments Regular readers of this blog know my Golden Rule If the doctors say I will never be able to wipe my own rear end again then unhook everything quickly and hasten my journey if possible To translate this into medical terms I would not want to live as a quadriplegic or be kept around if my brain would never have the ability again to write this column If this happens don t put me on any kind of support Stick two dozen large Fentanyl patches on my body and be sure to pull them off right after I die before the hospice nurse comes to clean up so no one gets in trouble After my non physician father had surgery for a newly diagnosed lung cancer he was told they couldn t remove it all and that he needed chemotherapy and radiation Having been through the death of my mother from cancer the year before his diagnosis and knowing the odds of his prognosis he decided against further treatment His doctors were indignant about his decision and said You ll be dead in six months He had many reasons for not undergoing treatment the poor prognosis the torture of the treatment and he missed my mom And there was one thing he said to me I found most incredible I brought this on myself Why should everyone else have to pay for this What happened after he turned down treatment He lived a pretty decent three more years and hospice was a blessing at the end That might not have happened if his doctor daughter hadn t explained the true prognosis and stood up for him against his aggressive doctors We all need to make the right decision for ourselves revisit it periodically because our desires change and communicate our thoughts well with the ones we love If this conversation is a regular part of our lives we will more richly appreciate now and be better prepared for the inevitable later As for the data Matthew desires About one quarter of our clients choose me as their health care surrogate or the back up to their spouse All clients have documented their wishes We ve made a pact that I will carry out their desires and stay within the letter of the law We should all have loved ones in our life who will do the same National Health Care Decision Day is just around the corner on April 16th Make it a priority to discuss your decisions with the ones you love Questions comments feedback would love for you to post here or you can reach me on Twitter CarolynMcC or at Carolyn mcclanahan gmail com to do a study on whether physicians die differently wouldn&rsquo;t be controlled, pass an ethics committee, or it would be picketed by the &ldquo;no, you can&rsquo;t go peacefully in the night&rdquo; coalition. advisor

"http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/dark_knight_workout.htm"	"564"	"{""title"":""The Dark Knight Workout Getting Ripped Finishing Strong "",""body"":""His workouts and nutrition program mirrored that of most of us in the fitness and iron game Mr Bale s physique and screen presence had to be perfect for this summer s biggest blockbuster Here s how he did it Article Summary Bale had to reveal an impressive physique for The Dark Knight Christian only had a few weeks to get the job done before filming This workout will force your muscles to grow lose fat be healthy The Dark Knight Workout It isn t hard to want the life of a celebrity While most of them may have fame and fortune a ripped physique is still not the norm No matter the line of work attaining a lean physique still takes considerable work and mental fortitude I often laugh when I hear people say that the only reason celebrities look great is because they have more money personal trainers and time Well in some cases these things can often spawn a worse physique Having a lot of time and money on your hands can lead to over eating laziness and being complacent We as humans all have the same physiology and therefore can all benefit from the same techniques to attain the leanness we all envy In his upcoming epic movie The Dark Knight Hollywood superstar Christian Bale had to reveal an impressive physique After all he had to fit in a skin tight suit maintain six pack abs and still have a screen presence of being tough Not easy to do Surprisingly though his workouts and nutrition program mirrored that of most of us in the fitness and iron game Mr Bale s physique and screen presence had to be perfect for this summer s biggest blockbuster Here s how he did it Nutrition The goal of this summers Dark Knight was to have a very lean yet muscular physique similar to the goal of many of us on Bodybuilding com Hence his diet was set up to take advantage of the anabolic window to support muscle growth and limit fat gains To do this most of his carbohydrates were consumed in the morning upon wakening and after his workout Times when glycogen would be at it s lowest and absorption of nutrients would support muscle rather than fat gains His choice of carbohydrates would mostly consist of those that were low on the glycemic index and would therefore keep insulin levels and energy more stable Workouts Christian Bale is known for his ability to transform his physique for various roles For the Machinist he dropped to double digits on the scale In fact many were worried that he wouldn t be able to gain enough weight to play the role of the dark knight Mr Bale not only pulled it off but brought forth a physique that many would be lucky to develop over years of training For anybody to accomplish this they must possess desire and knowledge It s one thing to really want a great body but knowing how is just as important Great Body On A Tight Schedule So he only had a few weeks to get the job done and we can all relate Granted we may not make 20 million dollars for attending our next reunion in ripped shape but at least we can hold our head high and know we truly accomplished something While it isn t advised to cut or gain weight quickly it can be done within reason Many don t advocate this because it is d mn near impossible Dropping weight fast often leads to considerable muscle loss and a scrawny physique Gaining weight fast often leads to little muscle gains and a lot of fat So if we are playing against the odds and trying to get in great shape fast we better be 100 on the money Workout Setup To make significant changes in your physique it helps to have been there before Muscle Memory is one our greatest allies If you were muscular and lean before it is much easier to get there again hence another reason to get in great shape even if it s just once Christian Bale had been there before and knew his body possessed the ability to become lean and muscular The Dark Knights Objective And Goals Attain A Lean Muscular Physique In Less Than 8 weeks Do not sacrifice muscle for weight loss obtain a balance and watch the mirror No cheating on nutrition must be 100 perfect Treat each set and rep like it s our last Each cardio session must be planned and pushed through The Nutrition Plan Consume just enough calories to gain or preserve muscle while still losing fat Keep insulin to an absolute minimum knowing it is most valuable at breakfast and post workout Consume most carbohydrates in the form of green vegetables and low on the GI scale Rolled Oats Ezekiel Bread Green VegetablesProtein must be high at least 1 25 g lbs of bodyweight The Training Plan Train to failure on each set this will activate the most high threshold fibers to initiate growth Favor more volume than intensity as the extra time in the gym will burn more calories Over training is not a major concern we have a movie to make Reps in the 6 12 range with various tactics such as supersets and drop sets Use mostly compound exercises to stimulate the most muscle Train 5 days per week with cardio 7 days per week Workout Setup This will hold true for all workout days Set 1 Setup 4 Sets x 6 8 10 12 Rest 2 Minutes Between Sets The high threshold fast twitch fibers will be activated right away with the heavy weights The higher reps that follow will stimulate other more endurance oriented fibers Wake up the fibers early and reap the rewards later All weights should be chosen accordingly so that the reps listed are able to be performed As an example don t pick a weight you could get 12 reps with for your 4 rep set Also don t forget to warm up thoroughly Set 2 Setup 3 Sets Of 10 12 reps Rest 1 Minute Between Sets Now since we have awoken the giant we will continue to punish you with higher reps and more intensity Now we are going to do 3 sets of 10 12 reps with one minute of rest in between Again pick an appropriate weight For example the first set pick a weight that will allow 12 reps but maybe you could have gotten 14 This way by the third set you will really have to struggle to get 10 Set 3 Setup Two Supersets One Drop Set Rest Just Long Enough To Catch Your Breath And Feel Your Arms Sorry no pain no gain We have a deadline here and you don t want to look good You have to look great Two supersets and one drop set will finish off this body part 30 minutes after each lifting session on a treadmill bike or elliptical This will definitely continue the fat burning as your lifting session will significantly reduce your stored glycogen which makes fat that much easier to tap into Don t forget to consume a fast digesting carbohydrate and protein source after your cardio session to start the rebuilding process Also I highly recommend taking in 10 15 g of BCAA and glutamine in the morning upon awakening and after your weight session to preserve muscle and protect your health The Dark Knight Workouts Monday Chest Triceps Tuesday Biceps Wednesday Quads Hamstrings Thursday Lats MidBack Friday Shoulders Saturday Sunday 30 Minutes Cardio Each Day Nutrition Plan Meal 1 Meal 2 Meal 3 Meal 4 After Workout But Before Cardio Meal 5 Immediately After Cardio Session Meal 6 Bedtime Conclusion There you have it The ultimate guide to your Dark Knight workout Undoubtedly Christian Bale had to train this intensely to transform his body for this summer s most anticipated movie This workout will force your muscles to change and give you just enough protein and carbohydrates to build muscle lose fat and keep you healthy If you can get through six weeks of this and are still standing you might not recognize yourself You might even star in a major motion picture don t blame us though eyady hotmail com Recommend this article to a friend by e mail here

Check Zucchini bread Check Zucchini chocolate cake and cookies and caponata and frittata and dip and Check check and double check Is there anything any combination of zukes flour eggs and herbs and spices and sugar and butter and fill in the blank we haven t thrown together to put a dent in the ever growing pile of zucchini outside the back door Methinks not Though we keep trying to come up with new uses for this all star of everyone s backyard garden Speaking of frittata my 90 year old MIL just happened to tell me her mother s zucchini frittata recipe yesterday over the phone This recipe must be just about 100 years old and it s been a favorite in my husband s family for decades Bet you d like to hear it right Fry grated zucchini Ma used 2 zucchini and 1 summer squash and chopped onion with olive oil in a spider cast iron pan Put eggs and Parmesan in a bowl When the zucchini and onion is cooked turn it out of the pan into the bowl with the eggs and cheese it should come right out without sticking Put the spider back on the stove to heat Stir the vegetables with the egg and cheese and pour back into the hot spider Put it in the oven to bake until it rises and turns golden brown Cut in wedges spread with butter and eat for breakfast Though my husband always liked my zucchini frittata it wasn t quite like Gram used to make Now I know Gram s secret and so do all of you But back to the task at hand finding new uses for heaven s gift to the green thumb challenged zucchini The following recipe for Zucchini Cheese Pancakes isn t new it s been on our site for years But it s been feeling neglected lately so what better time than the present to resurrect an old favorite These cakes aren t the type you serve with butter and maple syrup for breakfast Instead serve them just as they come off the griddle no embellishments needed Or spread hot cakes with butter if you like Serve the cakes at breakfast with eggs at lunch with a salad or try them alongside pasta at dinnertime They reheat nicely in the toaster and they re even good at room temperature wrap up a few cakes and stow in your backpack for your next hike And in the meantime stow this recipe in your bookmarks folder trust me you ll be needing it over the next few weeks Now on to the pancakes First grate a cup of cheese This is Parmesan I think it stands up well to the remaining ingredients in these cakes For best flavor choose a stronger Parmesan sharp cheddar rather than milder Monterey Jack mozzarella cheese Next grate some zucchini You need about 4 cups coarsely grated This translates to about 1 pound or about a 10 zucchini Stir together the following 4 large eggs lightly beaten1 4 cup olive oil or vegetable oil2 teaspoons salt to taste1 2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper or coarse black pepper2 3 cup chopped chives or scallions about 1 bunch scallions trimmed and chopped1 teaspoon dried basil 1 teaspoon dried oregano Substitute 2 teaspoons Pizza Seasoning for the dried herbs if desired reducing salt to 1 1 2 teaspoons Add the zucchini and cheese stirring to combine Add 1 3 4 cups 7 1 4 ounces King Arthur Unbleached All Purpose Flour stirring until the flour is thoroughly mixed in Preheat a griddle to medium hot about 400 F if you have an electric griddle Drop the batter by 1 4 cupfuls onto the hot lightly greased griddle A muffin scoop is the ideal tool here Now before you plop a whole lineup of cakes onto the griddle fry one cake first that ll let you get your griddle temperature down without burning or under cooking half your recipe If necessary spread the cake until it s 3 1 2 to 4 in diameter Cook the cake for 3 minutes or until it s brown on the bottom and bubbles have appeared on the top The top surface will appear somewhat dry and set Flip over and cook for about 3 to 4 minutes on the second side or until it s as moist cooked as you like when you break it open I like mine pretty moist inside but it s up to you Repeat with the remaining batter You can fit about 8 cakes on a nice size griddle Serve warm at room temperature or cold with butter and grated cheese or without Store any leftovers tightly wrapped in the refrigerator Reheat in a toaster or toaster oven if desired Read rate and review please our recipe for Zucchini Cheese Pancakes Print just the recipe So I couldn t resist trying the frittata My husband s comment Hey this is pretty good Which for him means Totally awesome you can definitely make this again Here s what I did 2 pounds zucchini summer squash 2 zucchini 1 summer squash grated1 large onion 11 ounces diced1 \u00bd cups 6 ounces grated Parmesan6 to 8 eggs I used 2 large and 4 jumbo First salt the squash put it in a colander weigh it down and drain for an hour or so Combine with the onion and fry in olive oil in a large 12 cast iron pan Fry until soft the vegetables will greatly diminish in volume Season to taste with salt and pepper Put the cheese and eggs in a bowl Add the vegetables and stir to combine Drizzle some olive oil into a smaller 9 to 10 cast iron skillet and heat it on the stovetop Spoon the vegetables into the pan and bake in a preheated 400 F oven for about 25 minutes until the frittata is light golden brown on top Serve hot in wedges Maybe tomorrow I ll have it for breakfast with butter Tags breakfast cheese pancakes zucchini This entry was posted

Nancy Rones22 ways to tackle life s biggest energy zappers Every day 2 2 million Americans complain of being tired Most of us chalk it up to having too much to do and not enough time to do it in especially during extra busy periods But often the true culprits are our everyday habits what we eat how we sleep and how we cope emotionally Read on for some simple recharging changes that can help you tackle all of the energy stealers in your life Energize Your Diet Why is it that filling up on pasta or Chinese food for lunch leaves us snacky and sleepy an hour later Or that falling short on fluids makes us forgetful and foggy Fact is eating habits play a powerful role in how well we function on every level Below six top fatigue fighting nutrition strategies to chew on Have breakfast even if you don t feel hungry You ll be a lot perkier Studies show that people who eat breakfast feel better both mentally and physically than those who skip their morning meal British researchers at Cardiff University even found that spooning up a bowl of breakfast cereal every morning is associated with lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol Eat every three to four hours Having three smallish meals and two snacks throughout the day can keep your blood sugar and energy levels stable all day long says Roberta Anding R D a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association ADA Note the word smallish Supersized meals demand more of your energy to digest which can leave you feeling lethargic At each mini meal get a mix of carbohydrates which the body uses for energy protein which helps sustain energy if needed and healthy fats like those found in fish nuts and olives these fats and protein contribute to meal satisfaction so you don t go hunting for sweets an hour later and wind up with a short lived sugar high and subsequent crash A few meal ideas a low fat yogurt parfait with berries and a couple of tablespoons of whole grain granola salmon over mixed greens with whole grain crackers and beef tenderloin with a baked sweet potato and asparagus Fill up on more fiber Fiber has a time releasing effect on carbs so they enter your bloodstream at a slow and steady pace giving your energy staying power says Anding When choosing your mini meals see above include fiber filled options that add up to the daily recommended 25 to 30 grams of fiber the average person gets only between 10 and 15 grams Some suggestions a bowl of raisin bran 5 grams of fiber per cup black beans and cheese wrapped in a multigrain tortilla beans have 7 5 grams per 1 2 cup one tortilla has 5 grams air popped popcorn 3 6 grams per 3 cups an apple with the skin 3 3 grams and whole wheat spaghetti 6 3 grams per cup Fuel your brain with omega 3s Found in fatty fish such as tuna and salmon walnuts and canola oil these essential fatty acids play a role in keeping brain cells healthy and helping you feel mentally alert Another potential bonus Omega 3s encourage the body to store carbs as glycogen the storage form of glucose blood sugar and the body s main source of stored fuel rather than as fat Stay hydrated Water makes up the majority of your blood and other body fluids and even mild dehydration can cause blood to thicken forcing the heart to pump harder to carry blood to your cells and organs and resulting in fatigue Also ample fluids keep energy fueling nutrients flowing throughout the body says Nancy Clark R D author of Nancy Clark s Sports Nutrition Guidebook To gauge your hydration Clark recommends monitoring how often you urinate You should be going every two to four hours and your urine should be clear or pale yellow in color Tip Besides drinking more you can also consume foods that naturally contain water such as yogurt broccoli carrots and juicy fruits like watermelons oranges and grapefruits Watch caffeine intake after noon Typically consuming a moderate amount of caffeine 200 to 300 mg the amount found in two to three cups of coffee can make you more energetic and alert in the hours following says Anthony L Komaroff M D a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School But when caffeine is consumed in large quantities or anytime in the afternoon or evening the quality of your sleep that night can take a nosedive leaving you with heavy eyelids the next day One caution for those who are highly sensitive to caffeine Although switching to a decaf latte in the afternoon sounds like the answer researchers at the University of Florida found that out of 22 decaffeinated coffee beverages tested all but one contained some caffeine 22 ways

24th February 2012 by GraceI love to entertain and these mini Chocolate Peanut Butter Mousse Cakes are the types of desserts I like to prepare for a cocktail party or a barbecue I usually make a trio of mini desserts including a cake option and a couple of spoon desserts what Italians like to refer to as Dolci al Cucchiaio This provides a variety from which my guests can choose and because they re small enough they can and usually do indulge in more than one And I ll tell you a secret about me I actually enjoy the preparations as much as the party I love everything from choosing the menu to cooking and setting the scene for the party I used to drive Moe crazy during the preparations That s because everything always had to be just so and he would always say You re making way too much food He was usually right but I m a firm believer that you can never have too much food or drink at a party It s better to have too much rather than not enough don t you agree Plus you never know when you re going to have a few extra guests join in on the fun The last thing I want to be worrying about when my family and friends are here is if I have enough food to feed everyone And I ve never met a guest that wasn t happy to take treats home We used to entertain often especially outdoors in the warmer summer months We even designed our backyard around the whole concept of entertaining Our family and friends refer to it as our resort At times it felt like we were entertaining every weekend It sure was a ton of work Here s another secret about me I miss those days I learned a valuable lesson from entertaining so often It s called KISS keep it simple stupid It took me a while to come to that conclusion I had to be dragged along kicking and screaming but I eventually got there And thankfully so Entertaining can be stressful in and of itself but if you make it too complicated you end up missing all the fun because you re worried about one thing or another Now I ll let you in on yet another secret These Mousse Cakes are one of my favourite simple recipes for entertaining How can Mousse Cakes be considered simple you ask They actually take only a little time to prepare and they can be prepared ahead of time This recipe also makes quite a few servings and can easily be doubled Another big plus in my book is that there s no baking involved And the cakes can also be served frozen That makes it a perfect summer dish If you think I m done listing the reasons why these Mousse Cakes are the perfect simple party dessert well I ve got another little surprise for you I ve saved the best for last What s the best reason for serving these peanut butter delights The taste I love the salty sweet combination and I like the play on textures For the crust I used a combination of Oreo crumbs and pecans making sure the pecans weren t processed too finely to give the crust a bit of a crunch The pecans also gave the crust a nutty flavour In fact there s a nutty motif throughout the dessert first in the pecan crust then in the velvety mousse and finally again when garnished with the chopped peanuts You can accuse me of gilding the lily on this one but it had to be done I added just a touch of chocolate lusciousness with a fudgy ganache So why am I sharing with you this perfect summer dessert today It may be a mild winter but it s still February Well my nephew Corey is visiting for the weekend Corey lived with us for a while a couple of years back and he hasn t been for a visit since moving back to Ottawa Our house always seems full of friends I have two teenagers but since Corey s here it feels even more festive than usual Corey came with a few cravings such as Aunt Grace s famous ribs and homemade pasta I knew the house would be filled with young adults so I made a mess of ribs and Texas cut fries for dinner last night I opted to serve the Chocolate Peanut Butter Mousse Cakes frozen and they were the perfect sweet ending to the meal I wanted to show you the versatility of this simple dessert recipe so I plated it three different ways mini mousse cakes mini Peanut Butter Parfaits and also cheesecake style with Reese s Peanut Butter Cups

foremost creme brulee experts In the 80s and early 90s it seemed to be on every dessert menu and if it was there I had to have it But even at that age I recognised that not all brulees were created equal The best had a crisp shell that shattered satisfyingly under my spoon and a rich smooth layer of custard beneath with just a whisper of vanilla Any softness on the top or graininess in the custard was not tolerated although as a professional I always cleaned the dish regardless Great was my childish joy when I learned that this dish was in fact British the usual story attributes it to Trinity College in Cambridge which boasts a dedicated branding iron in the shape of the college crest But in fact Jane Grigson suspicious of the late date 1860s given for this event in Florence White s Good Things in England uncovered a trail of recipes leading back to a 17th century manuscript book As she notes custards made from eggs and cream were a European commonplace at the time so it would

rubbery Mary s is I hate to say it slightly too liquid while Heston s perhaps because of the vast number of egg yolks he puts in is solid but rather jellied Larousse I will deal with later In fact Heston s brulee is so rich with eggs that I can t face going back for a second spoonful an unprecedented occurrence I think I could probably manage a good half of Claire s despite the nine yolks she puts in there like Lindsey and Simon s it s eggy but not overpoweringly sweet I prefer the creamier lighter flavour of Mary s brulee though so I decide to reduce the number of yolks and see whether I can achieve the same texture without such richness 3 seems about right for 300ml of cream Elizabeth Raffald s 1769 recipe reproduced in Jane Grigson s English Food uses egg whites as well as yolks beaten separately and added to the custard along with a spoonful of flour This gives her custard more body but a slightly off putting paste like texture and colour The sugar Mary Berry recipe creme brulee Photograph Felicity Cloake Everyone but Larousse uses caster sugar in their custards they go for icing sugar possibly because it dissolves more easily but it doesn t seem to make much difference in their case Mary and Larousse switch to demerara to top the brulees however which I like the slightly larger grains might not melt to such a smooth mirror like consistency but they stay nicely crunchy and give the top a distinctive burnt toffee flavour I need a happy medium between Heston s sickly 60g and Simon and Lindsey s parsimonious 1 tbsp after a little experimentation 15g for this amount of cream seems to work well The flavourings Heston Blumenthal recipe creme brulee Photograph Felicity Cloake Vanilla is of course the usual choice here Heston s three pods seem excessive he claims he serves this dish in espresso cups but it s so intensely flavoured that a teaspoon would seem a more appropriate vehicle Mrs Raffald uses lemon peel and orange flower water both of which are rather nice as ideas but have no place in the classic brulee Heston suggests jasmine tea infused in the hot milk before it s strained on to the egg yolks also pleasant although it does give the custard a slightly strange brownish tinge The method Claire Clark recipe creme brulee Photograph Felicity Cloake Most of the recipes I try Claire Clark Heston Mary Berry involve pouring hot milk or cream on to egg yolks and sugar mixing them together and then sticking the resulting custard in the oven for half an hour I can t believe how easy it is had I known creme brulee was so quick I d have gorged myself silly long ago But Simon Hopkinson and Lindsey Bareham have other ideas it seems that creme brulee is made differently these days they write disapprovingly Once upon a time one was instructed to make the custard in the traditional way cooked very gently in a pan until thick Of course they say it s easier to control the cooking time if one takes the easy way out but it does not give the same texture as the stove top method For their recipe then I heat the cream with a vanilla pod leave it to infuse for a while then pour it on to the egg yolks and sugar and return the whole lot to a pan and heat until it thickens to an almost jelly like consistency rather like in Mrs Raffald s recipe This is then ready to chill Simon and Lindsey describe the results as voluptuous but I think I prefer the light wobbliness of the baked versions Simon Hopkinson and Lindsey Bareham recipe creme brulee Photograph Felicity Cloake Larousse pique my interest by not bothering to heat the cream before whisking it into the eggs according to the instructions which I re read several times in the light of subsequent events the whole lot goes into the oven cold After 30 minutes no leeway given here they come out the consistency of creme anglaise Nor do they thicken at all during chilling I suspect a step may have been missed out of the English translation unless anyone can throw any light on this unusual method Baking and bruleeing Larousse Gastronomique s recipe creme brulee Photograph Felicity Cloake Of those brulees which make it into the oven temperatures range from 160C from Mary Berry to 100C for Larousse s culinary disaster Claire Clark s 150C with a cold water bain marie as opposed to the hot specified by Mary and Heston seems to work perfectly I m not quite sure why Mary butters her ramekins either she seems a practical lady so perhaps it makes them easier to clean Mary Larousse and Mrs Raffald call for the brulees to be grilled but if you have a blowtorch it s much easier to control the heat and because it s quicker you won t have to wait for the custard to cool again before serving the cool creaminess beneath the crunchy topping being surely one of the glories of this inspired dish Simon and Lindsey reckon spraying the sugar with water helps the caramelisation process but I find exactly the opposite I blame the blowtorch Perfect creme brulee Felicity s perfect creme brulee Photograph Felicity Cloake For some reason a bowl of custard isn t seen as an appropriate dessert for a grown adult but scorch the top and give it a French name and it s suddenly all sophisticated Good served with banana nevertheless Makes 2300ml double cream1 vanilla pod3 egg yolks15g caster sugar1 tbsp demerara sugar1 Preheat the oven to 150C and put 2 small ovenproof ramekins in a baking tin Pour the cream into a small heavy based pan and slit the vanilla pod in half lengthways Scrape out the seeds and put the pod and the seeds into the pan with the cream Bring to the boil over a medium low heat 2 Meanwhile put the yolks and caster sugar into a medium sized heatproof bowl and stir until just combined When the cream begins to boil remove the vanilla pod and then pour the cream on to the yolk and sugar mix stirring constantly to mix 3 Divide the mixture between the ramekins and pour cold water into the tin until it comes two thirds of the way up the ramekins Bake for about 40 minutes until the custard is set it should only wobble faintly when shaken Cool and then chill until cold 4 Scatter the tops of the cold brulees with demerara sugar and use a blowtorch or hot grill to caramelise the tops if using a grill you may need to put them back in the fridge for half an hour before serving to cool down again Creme brulee or burnt cream where do you stand on its origins Would you claim it for Spain instead or even as Julia Child insists Creole Louisiana Should they be strongly flavoured or sumptuously plain and which other classic desserts are surprisingly easy to make felicity cloake: for some reason, a bowl of custard isn't seen as an appropriate dessert for a grown adult  but scorch the top and give it a french name

lying to anyone But if a patient says they have to go and catch a bus we can sit with them at the bus stop and say Tell us about the buses you used to catch Rowan Harwood professor of geriatric medicine at Nottingham University agrees If it is done badly it could be infantilising But as long as they the patients are aware of what they are doing it s fine It s validation If they say I have to go and pick up the children and you just remind them the children are long grown up now they are going to be upset Jogging memories is key to getting into the world of the dementia sufferer adds Prof

III DC ND DACBN DABFM There is still much that remains a mystery about the disease fibromyalgia The exact cause of the condition continues to elude researchers although they have begun to develop several theories about what triggers the disease Possible culprits include stress injury or physical trauma emotional trauma lyme disease and a weakened immune system Here is a closer look at each of these factors and their possible role in the development of fibromyalgia Stress Stress is a normal part of everyday life Ordinary levels of stress typically do not present a problem for most people Our reactions to stress are measured by our ability to handle each stressful event Thus normal stress for one person might be quite overwhelming for another Stress can develop for a number of reasons A traumatic accident death or emergency may cause stress Stress can occur as a side effect of a serious illness or disease Daily life and work responsibilities and family pressures can also cause stress to develop High stress lifestyles are common in the United States The American culture is a high paced world of technology and instant access to information These patterns of stress can quickly lead to burn out where the individual can no longer function This condition of chronic burn out is universal in people who develop fibromyalgia For more help with stress please visit The Stress Anxiety Resource Center Injury or Physical Trauma Most individuals who suffer from fibromyalgia have a previous history of injury or physical trauma Falls motor vehicle accidents prolonged labor during childbirth loss of blood head traumas spinal injuries bone fractures surgeries internal injuries major dental work sports injuries and surgical operations are some examples of injuries and physical trauma that could lead to fibromyalgia symptoms The site of injury or trauma is also significant in the development of fibromyalgia The abdominal area is of particular concern as most fibromyalgia patients have experienced some type of abdominal injury or trauma pregnancy childbirth and cesarean section surgery are all considered abdominal trauma Cervical and lumbar whiplash injuries which may or may not involve disk problems and coccyx injuries are also common in fibromyalgia clients Some of these injuries or traumas may have occurred years before the onset of fibromyalgia Researchers believe that these injuries or traumas may somehow affect the central nervous system and be one of the causes of fibromyalgia Fibromyalgia may be associated with changes in muscle metabolism such as decreased blood flow to the muscles that causes fatigue and decreased strength These changes in muscle metabolism may occur as the result of a past muscle injury Emotional Trauma Emotional trauma can be just as devastating to the body as physical trauma Chronic worry anxiety fear anger sadness and grief are especially damaging to the body s energy levels and immune system defenses Most people have experienced some type of emotional trauma in their lives either through the loss of loved ones or the ending of relationships However these traumas may have been particularly severe for patients who suffer from fibromyalgia It is common for fibromyalgia sufferers to have experienced physical sexual or emotional abuse in the past Many fibromyalgia patients have suffered a series of traumatic events As with physical traumas these traumas may have occurred years before the onset of fibromyalgia Weakened Immune System Several factors can cause the immune system to become weak Emotional factors include prolonged stress depression and anxiety Physical factors such as poor nutrition sleep deprivation illness allergies and medications can reduce the effectiveness of the body s immunity Symptoms of a weakened immune system include fatigue susceptibility to illness especially colds and flues low stress tolerance recurrent infections easy bruising and slow wound healing Over time a weakened immune system can also cause fibromyalgia to develop In these cases patients often feel their fibromyalgia start with a cold or flu that just never seems to go away A toxic and compacted colon can also lead to a weak immune system I recommend a regular colon cleanse or Liver Cleanse to help with an optimal immune system Lyme Disease A recent study suggests that over 75 of the patients diagnosed with Fibromyalgia also have Lyme Disease Lyme Disease sometimes misspelled Lime Disease is so named because it was first identified in the United States Lyme Connecticut in 1975 However the history of Lyme Disease precedes its first United States diagnosis In Europe a skin rash with striking similarities had been described in medical literature around the turn of the century and it has been suggested that Lyme Disease may have spread to the United States from Europe in the early 1900 s The cause of Lyme Disease is a type of bacteria called a spirochete pronounced spi ro keet Its appearance under a powerful microscope is that of a cork screw The Lyme Disease spirochete is most often passed to humans by ticks deer ticks wood ticks or black legged ticks Therefore it is most common in wooded suburban areas Lyme Disease symptoms can often be misleading and difficult to diagnose Early symptoms starting within a few days of infection is often a rash starting with a red dot at the point of infection and radiating out The center may then fade creating a circular bulls eye pattern Other symptoms may include fevers chills stiff joints muscle ache and fatigue Because many symptoms may emulate other illnesses Lyme disease has often been called the Great Imitator Preventing Fibromyalgia There is little that can be done to prevent the injuries and traumas that will occur throughout our lives So the best way to prevent fibromyalgia in those who consider themselves susceptible is to minimize stress and restore the strength of the immune system Minimizing Stress Stress management techniques such as meditation yoga tai chi and deep breathing exercises are excellent ways to reduce stress in the body and mind and help alleviate the symptoms of fibromyalgia Exercise is another great stress reducer that also helps to improve the overall health of the body Strengthen The Immune System A healthy diet and regular exercise are the keys to a strong immune system A healthy diet will provide the body with the nutrients it needs to maintain and repair cells Exercise helps to move these nutrients as well as water and waste throughout the system Exercise also helps to improve the circulation and improve mobility in the joints there is still much that remains a mystery about the disease fibromyalgia. the exact cause of the condition continues to elude researchers, although they have begun to develop several theories about what triggers the disease. possible culprits include stress, injury or physical trauma,

"http://snosoft.blogspot.com/2010/04/hacking-your-bank.html"	"2435"	"{""title"":""Netragard s SNOsoft Research Team Hacking Your Bank "",""body"":""We were recently hired to perform an interesting Advanced Stealth Penetration test for a mid sized bank The goal of the penetration test was to penetrate into the bank s IT Infrastructure and see how far we could get without detection This is a bit different than most penetration tests as we weren t tasked with identifying risks as much as we were with demonstrating vulnerability The first step of any penetration test is reconnaissance Reconnaissance is the military term for the passive collection of intelligence about an enemy prior to attacking that enemy It is technically impossible to effectively attack an enemy without first obtaining actionable intelligence about the enemy Failure to collect good intelligence can result in significant casualties unnecessary collateral damage and a completely failed attack In penetration testing damages are realized by downed systems and a loss of revenue Because this engagement required stealth we focused on the social attack vectors and Social Reconnaissance We first targeted FaceBook with our FaceBook from the hackers perspective methodology That enabled us to map relationships between employees vendors friends family etc It also enabled us to identify key people in Accounts Receivable Accounts Payable AR AP In addition to FaceBook we focused on websites like Monster Dice Hot Jobs LinkedIn etc We identified a few interesting IT related job openings that disclosed interesting and useful technical information about the bank That information included but was not limited to what Intrusion Detection technologies had been deployed what their primary Operating Systems were for Desktops and Servers and that they were a Cisco shop Naturally we thought that it was also a good idea to apply for the job to see what else we could learn To do that we created a fake resume that was designed to be the perfect fit for a Sr IT Security Position one of the opportunities available Within one day of submission of our fake resume we had a telephone screening call scheduled We started the screening call with the standard meet and greet and an explanation of why we were interested in the opportunity Once we felt that the conversation was flowing smoothly we began to dig in a bit and start asking various technology questions In doing so we learned what Anti Virus technologies were in use and we also learned what the policies were for controlling outbound network traffic That s all that we needed Upon completion of our screening call we had sufficient information to attempt stealth penetration with a high probability of success The beauty is that we collected all of this information without sending a single packet to our customer s network In summary we learned That the bank uses Windows XP for most DesktopsWho some of the bank s vendors were IT Services The names and email addresses of people in AR APWhat Anti Virus technology the bank usesInformation about the banks traffic control policies Based on the intelligence that we collected we decided that the ideal scenario for stealth penetration would be to embed an exploit into a PDF document and to send that PDF document to the bank s AR AP department from the banks trusted IT Services provider This attack was designed to exploit the trust that our customer had with their existing IT Services provider When we created the PDF we used the new reverse https payload that was recently released by the Metasploit Project Previously we were using similar but more complex techniques for encapsulating our reverse connections in HTTPS We like reverse HTTPS connections for two reasons First Intrusion Detection Technologies cannot monitor encrypted network traffic Using an encrypted reverse connection ensures that we are protected from the prying eyes of Intrusion Detection Systems and less likely to trip alarms Second most companies allow outbound HTTPS port 443 because its required to view many websites The reverse HTTPS payload that we used mimics normal web browsing behavior and so is much less likely to set off any Intrusion Detection events Before we sent the PDF to the our customer we checked it against the same Antivirus Technology that they were using to ensure that it was not detected as malware or a virus To evade the scanners we had to pack our pseudo malware in such a way that it would not be detected by the scanners Once that was done and tested we were ready to launch our attack When we sent the PDF to our customer it didn t take long for the victim in AP AR to open it after all it appeared to be a trusted invoice Once it was opened the victim s computer was compromised That resulted in it establishing a reverse connection to our lab which we then tunneled into to take control of the victims computer all via HTTPS Once we had control our first order of operation was to maintain access To do this we installed our own backdoor technology onto the victims computer Our technology also used outbound HTTPS connections but for authenticated command retrieval So if our control connection to the victims computer was lost we could just tell our backdoor to re establish the connection The next order of operation was to deploy our suite of tools on the compromised system and to begin scoping out the internal network We used selective ARP poisoning as a first method for performing internal reconnaissance That proved to be very useful as we were able to quickly identify VNC connections and capture VNC authentication packets As it turns out the VNC connections that we captured were being made to the Active Directory AD server We were able to crack the VNC password by using a VNC Cracking Tool Once that happened we were able to access the AD server and extract the servers SAM file We then successfully cracked all of the passwords in that file including the historical user passwords Once the passwords were cracked we found that the same credentials were used across multiple systems As such we were not only able to access desktops and servers but also able to access Cisco devices etc In summary we were able to penetrate into our customers IT Infrastructure and effectively take control of the entire infrastructure without being detected We accomplished that by avoiding conventional methods for penetration and by using our own unorthodox yet obviously effective penetration methodologies This particular engagement was interesting as our customers goal was not to identify all points of risk but instead was to identify how deeply we could penetrate Since the engagement we ve worked with that customer to help them create barriers for isolation in the event of penetration Since those barriers have been implemented we haven t been able to penetrate as deeply As usual if you have any questions or comments please leave them on our blog If there s anything you d like us to write about please email me the suggestion If I ve made a grammatical mistake in here I m a hacker not an English major

reader Anna if I remember your name correctly Thanks for saying hi the other day at Ion Sorry if I appeared awkward or anything when you asked for a picture I was caught off guard Kick starting a break week of more location sourcing and test shoots Villa Bali January 2012 I Went on a short getaway to Bali with the sister during one of the weekends last month I am strongly for short getaways once every two months You come back refreshed and recharged you strive hard at work and then you go on another battery recharging trip two months later Now thinking of planning another short weekend trip in April Bangkok perhaps Guess which is mine I ve always loved window seats when I was a kid but now I d prefer aisle seats any time It kinda feels spacious somehow Our driver brought us for Ayam Penyet lunch after touchdown It s funny how we told him that we wanted to skip lunch and he still brought us there But glad that the language barrier brought us to good food Had a brief bad episode after we arrived at our initial villa accommodation Nunia Private Villas We were told that there was no room available for us because our middleman agency Villas Indonesia have not been paying them for months Luckily after kicking up a huge fuss even got our Indonesian friends for help with the slight language barrier they transferred us to another villa The first thing we did was to hit the pool to cool off metaphorically and literally We spent the rest of the day exploring the Semniyat area same top different day Proof that you can get good wearable things out of souvenir shops bought a number of that particular pouch in pretty batik designs from Bali Wishing I bought more now Thank you Tongue in Chic for the top ten Southeast Asian bloggers to watch out for in 2012 feature Pardon my Spongebob web template heheh the missing companion Been spending the past few days stressing over my final major project I think I m really bad at scouting out locations for photoshoots In times like this I wish my favorite travel around Singapore for photo ops companion was here namely Andy Lee Or maybe someone anyone could loan me your eye for aesthetics On a totally random note here s a silly conversation between Andy and I It s official When the doctor banned me from fast food for at least a month or two my world came crashing down Dragon Year Day3 A rather somber steamboat dinner at S Glad to see the girls happy with their other halves nonetheless Dragon Year Day2 Not sure if it s psychological but I think my love for anything purple has evidently slipped into my choice of clothing The Ko Family Sisters Wallowing in self pity and recuperating at home since yesterday s terribly sick episode Chest tightness breathlessness vomiting and diarrhea since 3am the day before a recurring problem but so much worse this time round Checked into A E in the morning and went through blood tests which pissed me off quite terribly because my veins were apparently too small and they made 4 failed attempts at needle poking various parts of my hands arms urine test x rays ECG and CT scan Ended up diagnosing my condition as hyperventilation and declared that there s no specific cure for it other than keeping calm and controlling my breathing Can t take this as an explanation when I m still feeling unwell AND I do feel absolutely calm Guess I can only pray now "",""url"":""camerafilmroll

Tonight I ll login and post addresses of two mail order places that sell new genuine mil surplus stuff There s a lot of cheap copies of mil surplus stuff out there and it s not as good quality The U S Cavalry Store catalogue has nice little Official Issue stamps on all the appropriate items which helps a lot The local surplus places are pretty poor pickings unless you re an experienced shopper but hey check em out yourself on a weekend If nothing else you find lots of cool stuff to examine and they often do carry useful mundane things like camping gear or knives The best I have is U S Cavalry Store 2855 Centennial Ave Radcliff KY 40160 9000 Orders 1 800 626 6171 Fax 1 502 352 0266 Store 502 351 1167 The second best is Brigade Quartermasters 1025 Cobb International Blvd Kennesaw GA 30144 4300 Orders 1 800 486 4327 FAX 404 426 7726 Telex 54 2461 Store 404 428 1234 Both places sell hunting camping and mil surplus type stuff I think U S Cavalry has a better selection so if you ordered only one catalogue that would be the one U S Cavalry has official military issue items so listed which makes it easier to pick them out They also have stuff like MREs water purifiers goretex clothing knives flashlights backpacks sleeping bags etc Both places also stock a selection of books on wilderness survival and other esoteric subjects Note a few things in these catalogs may be illegal to carry or in a couple of cases own in California Unless you decide to order something bizarre like a blowgun or nunchaku you shouldn t have any problems but be aware BOTH places I noted sell paramedic shears if anyone is interested The serrated edge referred to is probably the Spyder Edge developed by Spyderco knifes and now ripped off uh I mean proudly used by other manufacturers I believe it s supposed to last longer than a flat edge and cuts better The primary down side is that it requires a special crockstick affair to sharpen when it does get dull but I think this is pretty easy if you have the crockstick set o SI Outdoor Food and Equipment P O Box 3796 Gardena Ca 90247 213 324 8855 They publish a catalog of specials bi monthly It takes several issues of the catalog to get through their whole product line There is a good source for alternative energy equipment called Real Goods They sell an inch thick book catalog for 10 I ll get their address and put it out in another email A surgical supply house is the only place to buy supplies for trauma Drug stores don t carry the quality or selection of items that are needed to really render serious care Two companies that are

cruiser Birds were littering the streets the yards the driveways everywhere said Robby King a county wildlife officer It was hard to drive down the street in some places without running over them How They died from massive trauma said Game and Fish Commission spokesman Keith Stephens citing a report from the state poultry lab where the birds were examined Some speculated that a bout of bad weather was to blame Others said one confused bird could have led the group in a fatal plunge A few spooked schoolkids even guessed that the birds had committed mass suicide Beebe police captain Eddie Cullum said For all the doomsdayers that was definitely the end of the world Where The second unexplained US mass bird death happened in Louisiana where carcasses littered a stretch of highway near Baton

Jim LaCour said Two dozen of them had head neck beak or back injuries Dan Cristol a biology professor and co founder of the Institute for Integrative Bird Behavior Studies at the College of William

birds were found lying dead on the road Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet reported How Local veterinarian Robert ter Horst speculated that the birds had fallen from the sky after being frightened by fireworks set off late on Tuesday However the cause of the jackdaws deaths was disputed after a truck driver claimed he was responsible Christer Olofosson a rescue services worker said the truck driver claimed he saw about 70 live birds on the road on Tuesday saying he ran over the lot of them and did not think it was a big deal He later realised it had attracted attention not only in the

you ever wanted to know about the grilled cheese everything you ever wanted to know about the grilled cheese everything you ever wanted to know about the grilled cheese | greatist"",""body"":""Illustration by Shannon Orcutt It s a simple equation Bread butter cheese happiness The grilled cheese sandwich is one of the most popular and easiest sandwiches of all time kids love them undergrads live off of them and foodies obsess over gourmet versions of them So what s the big deal How did toast and cheese first become perfect lovers The Greatist team dove between the slices to investigate how the grilled cheese rose to fame what with gooey cheese wedges blowing up Pinterest boards and restaurants devoted to making the cheesy fixture and how to make the best one A Brief History of the Glorious Grilled Cheese Variations of cheese and bread both staples of many international diets have existed for centuries but toasting the duo is a fairly modern phenomenon An open faced version of the grilled cheese gained popularity in 1920s America right along with the rise of inexpensive processed bread and cheese In the U S it was first called a toasted cheese or melted cheese sandwich Grilled cheese became a staple as a simple way to get some protein fat and carbs all in one bite International versions have existed for years including toast from Israel kasarli tost from Turkey and toasties from Britain Other meatier versions also exist like the French croque monsieur the Dutch tosti kaas and Scottish roasted cheese The sandwich then called a cheese dream gained even more popularity during the Great Depression as rations grew slim But grilled cheese has gone from functional staple to luxe dinner item thanks to a little help from Kraft singles which debuted in 1949 and helped promote grilled cheese as a nostalgic childhood treat The Sandwich Now Americans consume more than two billion grilled cheese sandwiches a year That s a whole lot of sandwiches It s undoubtedly delicious however the grilled cheese isn t always the healthiest meal option Cheese and bread can top the dangerfood list and a big pat of butter doesn t help much either So how do we welcome the grilled cheese back into our hearts and tummies Read on How to Make the Healthiest Grilled Cheese Now that we ve got your mouth watering we re going to break down the grilled cheese essentials and how to make this easy inexpensive except for maybe this one and satisfying sandwich a better way BreadGrilled cheese usually calls for two slices of white bread which are low in nutritional value Try whole wheat or whole grain bread to add filling fiber to the equation CheeseWhile American cheese sounds patriotic and melts easily it has comparably less punch than other varieties Choose sharper cheese like an aged cheddar The cheese s natural kick will let you use less in the sandwich while getting the same amount of flavor Using less cheese will cut fat and calories but thankfully a little cheese isn t all bad it s a good source of calcium and can have nine grams of protein per ounce Pro tip Skip the fat free cheese No fat means the cheese won t melt easily If you ve got a block of cheese instead of thin slices try grating it for even coverage If sharp cheddar doesn t suit your fancy there are other flavorful cheeses that are perfect for a grilled cheese sandwich Gruyere This nutty sometimes sweet cheese has almost nine grams of protein for an ounce and double the calcium of other cheeses As far as flavor goes a little goes a long way Brie This rich cheese has less sodium that many other cheeses and is soft and spreadable Goat Available in soft and hard varieties this cheese is tangy and often comes in different flavor varieties like herbed with fruit or honey It s got about 1 3 less calories and 1 3 the fat per ounce compared to cow s milk cheese It s also safe for many people with lactose intolerance Mozzarella This cheese melts nicely but it is milder than other cheeses Part skim mozz has got half the fat as most other cheeses and can still melt well but shy away from non fat versions that won t melt down as easily Extra ToppingsWhile grilled cheese is often paired with tomato soup it s easy to sneak some healthy stuff right in the sandwich itself Fill other goodies in between the slices like thinly sliced tomato avocado apple pear or spinach CookingInstead of frying a grilled cheese in a pan of melted butter try a panini maker or lightly spray a saut\u00e9 pan with heart healthy olive oil If you ve simply got to have a little buttery flavor melt down a pat and brush it on the bread If using a pan warm it on medium low to prevent burning Place the bread in the pan butter or oil side down Immediately add cheese and other fillings Top with a second slice of bread butter or oil side facing out Cover with a lid to help melt the cheese and cook for about two minutes Flip and cook on the other side for a minute or until golden brown If you d like to make it without oil or butter try wrapping the sandwich in foil and popping it in the toaster oven Pro tip Pressing it on a Panini will produce a more dense less fluffy

Groupies stuff you should know: groupies"",""body"":""If it weren t for rock groupies we wouldn t know half the stuff we do today about the size and stamina of rock stars we ll never meet Say what you will about the importance of reporting to us that Jimi Hendrix had a huge penis and Mick Jagger s is tiny but these are some women who are going out and getting what they want You can t be mad at that Modern Day Groupies When you think of groupies it s often with that image of a fur clad bell bottomed Kate Hudson in Almost Famous But groupies didn t die out with Penny Lane Thanks to certain corners of the Internet groupie culture has actually been able to flourish in the last 10 years or so Modern day groupies meet online to share information like WARNING ART ALEXAKIS FROM EVERCLEAR IS A SELFISH LOVER or STEVEN TYLER HAS A WEAKNESS FOR STRIPPERS Aside from the fact that women actually wanted to bang the dude from Everclear neither of those thing surprise us There is strangely very little competition The tidbits are often in the name of helping each other but it seems these women just need to share their exploits with somebody your friends can only hear so many times that so and so rockstar s type is stripper The online groupies are a pretty peaceful bunch who seem to respect each other which is more than you can say of most forums Old School Groupies The hippie dippy culture of Haight Ashbury in the 1960 s is what gave birth to the famous rock groupie as we know them today The girls sick of the hippie scene came over to L A in the late 1960 s to hang out on Sunset Boulevard with The Stones Led Zeppelin Jimi Hendrix and the rest And the most famous of the groupies even formed their own music group despite the fact that none of them could play instruments GTO member Cynthia Plaster Caster famously also made molds of the rock star s penises the first one she cast Jimi Hendrix was also the largest and you can apparently buy a replica of Jimi s famous wang for 2 000 Having this one on display won t scare potential dates away once you explain it Right Famous Groupies Groupies started to really reach fame in the 70 s There was an entire magazine Star devoted to Groupie culture The stars of the magazine were known as baby groupies because they were majorly under age 13 17 Wait what Lori Madoxx and Sable Starr were Star Magazine favorites Starr lost her virginity to Iggy Pop who would later write a song about the incident Lori got her start by losing her virginity to David Bowie also at 13 Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin saw Lori in the pages of Star and swore he was gonna meet her In true slash romance novel lore he had his tour manager kidnap her and take her back to the hotel Lori recounted laying in his bed while he was on the phone with his girlfriend back home which was apparently okay But it was not okay when Page started sleeping with Bebe Buel a fellow groupie and Liv Tyler s future mother Lori tore into the hotel room swinging and apparently Page seemed amused Okay wait we re still stuck on this Somehow at one time it was socially okay for adult rock stars to date 13 year olds Later famous groupies were no longer just famous for being groupies but used their groupie fame to launch other careers Pamela Anderson Carmen Electra Tawny Kitaen and lots more all got their start dating high profile musicians What We Can Learn From Modern Day Groupies Thanks to the modern day groupie forums there s a lot you can learn about the rock stars you grew up listening to According to a user on a groupie forum Maynard James Keenan of Tool was super nice when she refused to have sex with him He was very respectful and we ended up just hanging out on his tour bus drinking wine with his friends and three other fans Afterwards we exchanged emails For two years we wrote back and forth about his travels and whatever was happening in my life I even hung out with him again backstage still no sex and didn t even need a pass his body guard just escorted me But I messed it up when I went to Italy and fell in love with some boy and just stopped writing to him What can I say I was only 21 Of course rock stars can also be mean another user reports that Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins is famously rude She says she was backstage at an event where Corgan backhanded a DJ in the face a woman then tried to act like it was no big deal Reading their accounts you also start to get a sense of what the modern rockstar lifestyle entails Apparently a few years back Marilyn Manson was auditioning girlfriends via Myspace He would invite them over the mansion to see if he liked them The porn star Stoya was apparently a Myspace winner and was a girlfriend for a few months How has this not become a staple VH1 show I m waiting Oh Apparently There Are Male Groupies On one of the forum threads the girls vent about the male groupies backstage They complain that male groupies are often more aggressive and do things like cut them off when they are talking or belittle them in front of band members Pleather is known as the only famous male groupie who pops up during the 90 s when we begin to see a lot more women in rock Pleather was interviewed by famed 60 s journalist Pamela Des Barres about his exploits He s famously spent time with Courtney Love who he recounts to Des Barres has shaky self esteem If that s all he has to say about Ms Love well yawn Totally Random Things You Need to Know Groupie Central conducted a survey among groupies asking who is the best lover and hands down it went to Steven Tyler Ladies talked up his oral skills glad to know that mouth is being put to good use and some groupies reported having threesomes with Steven and fellow Aerosmith member Joe Perry Who knew that people were laying boy bands According to a dated and hilarious write up about the Backstreet Boys Groupies say that A J doesn t like to use condoms and he s a backdoor man Also Glen Danzig of Misfits fame has a five inch penis Which is a pretty banal size to report on but okay noted Eminem actually hired a groupie wrangler for a 2003 tour a body guard especially for handling groupies and in Em s case keeping them away Maybe it s because he s a forum favorite Girls gush about his apparently ginormous member and proclivities for cell phone recording the escapades Groupie Central sent out a warning about ICP The members of Insane Clown Posse are rude crude and treat their groupies like dirt The clowns are so desperate for attention that they ll take practically any groupie no matter what she looks like Violent J has a big penis but he doesn t have much stamina and he s secretly self conscious about being overweight Aw And last but not least that guy from the Goo Goo Dolls is into BDSM If you re ever in a cheesy dungeon club and Slide is playing in the background you know why  a look at how groupies have evolved over the years and what the current state of groupie life is like. a look at how

a food item instead of tossing the extra bit out This is not only less wasteful it saves cash This page is a compilation of individual Quick Tips previously published that will be deleted from the Tipnut blog they ve been moved here all on one handy page for convenience Have a cup or so of rice left over from last night s meal that you don t know what to do with Toss it into your lunchtime vegetable soup or even chicken broth Bulks up the soup a bit and saves the rice from being tossed out Make big batches of rice and freeze in meal size portions to use later when preparing quick meals When freezing individual sized portions freeze with leftover veggies meats and sauces for hassle free cheap work lunches Drop large spoonfuls of any leftover whipped cream on a wax paper lined cookie sheet and freeze Once frozen individually store them in a freezer bag You can use these on desserts and hot beverages like hot chocolate and coffee just let them thaw a bit first These don t store long though use within two weeks For excellent homemade whipped cream try this Real Whipped Cream Recipe second recipe Freeze your leftover tea in ice cube trays with a mint leaf or a curl of lemon zest even a slice of lemon Use the frozen cubes to chill and flavor iced tea when serving Great for large batches or individual servings Have eggs that need to be used up before they expire Eggs can be frozen whole or separated in amounts usually needed For example If you make your own mayonnaise freeze in containers the number of eggs yolks you normally use per batch In another container freeze egg whites Once a fresh banana is too ripe to eat don t throw it out you can freeze it in a number of ways see this tip includes a recipe for banana bread If you can t eat the grapes fast enough before they start going bad try freezing them First wash the grapes well allow to dry then lay them neatly on a cookie sheet not touching each other Place the tray in the freezer and once the grapes are frozen transfer them to a freezer bag or airtight container Store in the freezer and just take out what you need when you want a cold fruity treat eat them as is frozen or add to things like yogurt smoothies and ice cream This also works well for berries raspberries blueberries pitted cherries etc When needing just the broccoli florets save the uncooked stems wash well and chop finely Store in an airtight container and refrigerate Add the stem bits to salads and cooked dishes like rice or scrambled eggs This not only helps prevent waste it also adds a little health boost to your

of wine for most sauces and dishes you can measure 1 tablespoon amount in each cube If you have part of a bell pepper left over from a recipe and no other immediate use for it just slice it into strips or dice whichever you prefer seal in a freezer bag and freeze You can also freeze whole bell peppers see Freezing Bell Peppers If you have apples that are no longer that fresh but still good to eat here s a tip to use them up fast Cut apples into wedges fry slowly in a bit of butter and then sprinkle with cinnamon Your kids will eat them up lickety split If you re really ambitious use them to make an apple crisp or apple pie Store leftover nuts like walnuts and almonds in an airtight container and keep in the freezer This will keep them fresh and tasty This will also prevent them from

in Women Via A Viral Video 10 often-missed signs of heart attack in women - via a viral video - forbes"",""body"":""Oops My Heart May Not Be In Such Good Shape Making the viral rounds of Facebook Twitter Email and good old non virtual word of mouth is Just a Little Heart Attack a hilarious video produced for the American Heart Association AHA showing a typical overworked stressed out modern super mom having a heart attack while trying to to cope with the pressures of work and motherhood The video a cornerstone of the AHA s new Go Red for Women campaign does a great service in highlighting how different heart attack symptoms may appear in women and how often women ignore them because they re not the traditional signs always depicted in movies and warning materials As the woman in the video staggers around the kitchen attempting to finish making her kids lunches and get them off to school she downplays her symptoms until she finally drops a plate and collapses And even once she s lying on the floor and it dawns on her that she s in serious trouble she speaks apologetically to the 911 dispatcher explaining that she might have had a little heart attack Ha we say hitting the share button But it s not so funny The symptoms depicted in the video are pretty darn on the mark according to several recent studies including one conducted by the National Institutes of Health NIH and published in the AMA s journal Circulation that asked women who d had heart attacks to retroactively analyze their health and symptoms Here 1o often missed symptoms women experience when having a heart attack 1 Sweating or Feeling Overheated Is it hot in here Suddenly feeling your temperature spike as if someone turned up the heat can be a sign of heart attack The actress in the video starts fanning herself and undoing the top buttons of her blouse as she gets red faced and sweaty for no apparent reason If you re perimenopausal or menopausal these symptoms can mimic a hot flash making them particularly difficult to recognize 2 Indigestion or Nausea Waves of nausea stomach ache cramps and diarrhea are another sign reported by women after having a heart attack If you suddenly begin feeling nauseous and sick to your stomach and can t think of any food related reason for it pay attention Of course you ll likely attribute this symptom to stomach flu or food poisoning but ask yourself if you ve recently eaten anything iffy or been exposed to an intestinal bug 3 Ear Jaw Neck or Shoulder Pain This is where the video is truly revealing The actress rubs her jaw neck and shoulder with a bewildered expression on her face as if experiencing an inexplicable pain Traditional heart attack warning materials describe sudden pain and in the chest and movies always depict a heart attack sufferer clutching hischest with a stricken expression Yet women more often than not don t experience the pain this way Instead many women say they felt a sensation of tightness running along their jaw and down the neck and sometimes up to the ear Numbness and pain may extend down to the shoulder and arm particularly on the left side or it may feel like a backache or pulled muscle in the neck and back 4 Exhaustion or Fatigue The woman in the video begins to visibly sway with exhaustion as if she s so tired she d like to sink to the ground which she eventually does More than 70 percent of women in the NIH study reported extreme fatigue in the month or months prior to their heart attacks This was not just your run of the mill tiredness the kind you can power through this was an overwhelming fatigue that sidelined them from their usual schedules for a few days at a time 5 Sleeplessness or Insomnia A feeling of being wired despite being exhausted is one of the telltale signs of heart attack In the NIH study many women described having unexplained insomnia racing thoughts and a feeling of being keyed up during the weeks that preceded their heart attack They noticed the racing thoughts and wired feeling particularly before they fell sleep or found themselves waking frequently and being unable to fall back asleep 6 Stress and Anxiety Stress has long been known to up the risk of heart attack But too often women don t perceive the stress as unusual since their lives are so pressured and harried all the time anyway They tend to focus on the emotional experience instead wondering if they re having psychological problems According to the women in the NIH study they felt anxious stressed and keyed up noticeably more than usual Moments before or during a heart attack many women report a feeling they describe as impending doom they re aware that something s drastically wrong and they can t cope but they re not sure what s going on 7 Shortness of Breath Of the women in the NIH study more than 40 percent remembered experiencing this symptom One of the comments the women made is that they noticed they couldn t catch their breath while walking up the stairs or doing other daily tasks women often don't realize they're having a heart attack because their symptoms are different from the traditional signs depicted in movies and warning materials. the

with a few new wing recipes in last month s tailgating test kitchen My goal was to successfully fuse the cuisine of the countries I ve traveled to this year with the all American chicken wing official food of all American football These wings are more about intense flavor than heat few flavors are more intense than sour pungent slightly fruity tamarind which I ate a lot of in India along with plenty of garlic and ginger But I flew through London hence the Newcastle Don t worry we re going back to India for the heat very soon If you get whole wings instead of pre cut drumettes and wing portions just locate the joint between the two and drive the tip of a sharp knife right in they should snap apart fairly easily Servings 12 wings Ingredients 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 clove garlic minced 1 1 inch piece ginger root peeled and smashed 1 bottle dark beer we used Newcastle 2 tablespoons tamarind chutney available at any Indian or Middle Eastern grocery 1 teaspoon agave nectar kosher salt 6 chicken wings separated at the joint 12 total pieces 1 tablespoon canola oil a few dashes hot sauce optional Directions 1 Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat and saut\u00e9 the garlic and smashed ginger until fragrant 2 3 minutes stirring frequently 2 Add the tamarind agave nectar and hot sauce if using stir to coat completely then slowly add the beer to prevent it from foaming over 3 Bring to a light boil then lower to a simmer and cook until reduced by half or until the glaze coats the back of a spoon 4 Season the chicken wings lightly with Kosher salt 5 Heat the canola oil in a large non stick skillet over medium high heat and brown the chicken wings for 8 10 minutes turning once 6 Preheat the oven to 375F then transfer the wings to a foil

"http://authorjaneward.wordpress.com/"	"2987"	"{""title"":""Food and Fiction food and fiction"",""body"":""On a pretty regular basis the question Who was the first person to eat fill in the blank will sidetrack me from a task at hand It may seem like woolgathering but really the question is a pretty powerful one Think about it Once the mind starts to wonder about the first person to spot an artichoke for example and decide it looked edible the imagination kicks in and fleshes out a plucky individual Curious adventurous a bit of a risk taker and probably very very hungry Indeed hunger must have outweighed risk back in the day of the first artichoke eater or first consumer of any unfamiliar food Hunger would have been the great push damn the consequences When some brave soul first looked at tall grassy wheat and came up with the idea of grinding it to a flour turning the flour into a paste with water and airborne yeasts shaping this concoction into a cake and then sticking it into fire that person risked the possibilities of both generic failure if the baked cake amounted to nothing and abject failure if the plant were toxic But he or she did it anyway And quite the opposite of failing happened the risk changed the world Once wheat and other grains could be milled into flours people became farmers instead of subsistence foragers They could live close to each other instead of roaming they were certain of eating because of what they produced Communities grew and people thrived Around bread Because of bread For modern communities bread still matters I spent an hour yesterday morning visiting and talking with Alyse Barbash Executive Director of Haven From Hunger a large scale community food pantry and soup kitchen serving three towns on the north shore of Massachusetts Alyse is the kind of person every food pantry wants as its head Bighearted but tough Empathetic but savvy Kind with a generous dose of sassy A creative problem solver she knows how to get things done She has to As Director Alyse manages a fleet of volunteers multiple food deliveries and relationships with town officials and potential donors and regional food banks and farms and area restaurants And for four days during the week her pantry opens at 10 am to lines waiting down the block for grocery pickup and stays open through the dinner hour to serve many in the area a prepared hot meal Hunger brings people here it s the push that gets them through the door Alyse and staff feed them Inside the building on Wallis Street long tables are lined with grocery bags pre packed and full with meats and dairy products and dry goods Fresh greens and parsnips sit in self selection bins There s bread too loaf after loaf of whole grain bread As she wrapped my tour of the facility Alyse pointed to the table piled high with plastic sacks of sliced bread Food deliveries change but we always have bread Lots and lots of it Different times different hardships but hunger remains the same Bread too Bread still sustains people and communities and allows both to thrive We owe this to some curious adventurous risk taking hungry eater Worthy of a little purposeful woolgathering don t you think This Week s Pumpkin Multigrain Yeast Bread Unlike spiced pumpkin tea breads or muffins this yeast bread is savory and toothsome I used up the last of last weekend s fresh pumpkin puree in this bread but you may also used canned pumpkin puree I give a range of the amount of flour needed for the recipe Fresh pumpkin will probably require more flour while canned pumpkin will require less Start by using the smaller amount and add more as needed The recipe makes two loaves or one loaf and a pan of dinner rolls One for keeping one for giving Think about giving one away 3 4 cup tepid water 1 Tbsp dry yeast 1 4 cup honey 1 4 cup vegetable or canola oil 2 large eggs at room temperature 3 4 cups pumpkin puree homemade or canned 4 3 4 5 1 4 cups unbleached all purpose flour 1 2 cup multigrain blend available in bulk bins at natural grocery stores or from King Arthur Flour 1 1 2 tsp kosher salt 1 egg beaten with 1 Tbsp water for glaze optional Place the yeast and tepid water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook Add to this the honey and canola oil Let stand until yeast foams Once foamy add the eggs and pumpkin puree Mix with the dough hook until the yolks are broken and begin to combine with the liquids and pumpkin Add to the bowl 4 3 4 cups flour the salt and the multigrain blend Set your stand mixer to the manufacturer s recommended setting for kneading and knead the dough for 8 minutes or until an elastic dough forms a ball that does not stick to the bottom or sides of the bowl During the first 5 minutes of kneading add up to another 1 2 cup of flour 2 Tbsp at a time as needed to reach the right consistency Homemade pumpkin puree will require more flour than canned Oil a bowl and place the dough ball in it turning it once or twice to coat it with the oil Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place the dough in a warm place to rise until doubled Egg enriched doughs take longer to rise so rising may take 1 to 2 hours Spray either two loaf pans or 1 loaf pan and one 9 round pan with non stick spray Gently deflate the risen dough on a wooden board or other work surface Divide evenly in half Working with one piece at a time roll the dough into a long oval that is slightly wider at one end Starting from the wide end roll the dough into a log or torpedo shape tucking the narrow end under the log Place this in the loaf pan seam side down Repeat with the other half for a second loaf For rolls use the second piece and divide it into 8 even pieces Form each into a small smooth ball and set in the round pan Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Cover pans with plastic wrap that has been sprayed with non stick spray Let rise in a warm place until the top of the loaf crests the pan by about half an inch Brush the tops

nanny that your employer has ever engaged your charges may think that you re the best thing since peanut butter and jelly you may be willing to perform the occasional non childcare related tasks and you might hold a college degree in childhood development or education No matter how competent and qualified you are there will inevitably come a time when you re not quite in your employer s good graces no one can perform flawlessly all the time and tempers can be notoriously short when parents are resentful of the time that they re forced to spend away from their children Rather than panicking and putting out feelers for a new post consider your options and the best methods for salvaging your existing engagement Realize That These Things Are Rarely Permanent Unless you ve committed a major transgression the chances of your employer resorting to drastic disciplinary measures are fairly slim Provided that you ve been an otherwise good employee most parents would rather resolve an existing problem than take on the Herculean task of sorting through dozens of resumes and conducting nerve wracking tedious interviews That being said it s not wise to be too secure in your position if you re overly cocky and consistently go against their wishes your employers will eventually have all that they can take Confront the Issue Head On If you know that your employer is angry but haven t been approached with a reprimand or a request for an explanation it s best to take the bull by the horns and approach her with your concerns It s especially smart to make an effort to mend fences if you know why your employer is upset and agree that you are in the wrong Letting the situation go unacknowledged for too long can cause resentment to build up and exacerbate the problem so don t dodge your employer in hopes that things will blow over Be Honest Should your employer confront you with questions about an incident in which you know you were in the wrong don t give into the temptation to cover your tracks Admitting that you were wrong and are willing to accept any penalties as a result of your poor choices shows strong character and moral fiber in addition to being the right thing to do it may also impress your employer enough that they second guess their outrage Keep Your Own Temper in Check Being accused of misconduct whether you re guilty or innocent is enough to put almost anyone on the defensive Taking this tack with your employers as a reaction to questioning or accusations will only escalate the situation and perhaps lead to the loss of a post that you would otherwise have been able to retain Remember the old adage about flies and honey and realize that anger even of the righteous variety will get you nowhere in these situations Accept Responsibility For Your Actions Attempting to pass the buck or blame someone else for your failure to perform properly or your momentary lapse in judgment isn t likely to endear you to your already upset employers instead face the consequences of a poor choice as gracefully as possible Whining or shifting blame isn t just ineffective it s often downright counterproductive Make a Concerted Effort to Make Up It s easy to hold your breath and hope that a tumultuous period in your relationship with your employer will pass without any attempts to mend fences on your part but that s almost never the case Extending the olive branch isn t always the easiest thing to do especially if you feel that you have nothing to apologize for still preserving that relationship and perhaps your post itself may depend upon your ability to do just that Keep the Conversation Behind Closed Doors Your charges your friends and other nannies at the playground don t need to hear you air your grievances or discuss an ongoing problem you have with your employer Even in the largest most densely populated cities most social circles are relatively small and people will talk Letting news of your woes get back to your employers is a surefire way to make them give up on you altogether so make sure that you keep any and all conversations about the state of your relationship with your employers and the details surrounding it away from the public eye Depending upon the severity of your mistake and the potential repercussions you may want to consider the possibility that your job could be in danger though it s not altogether likely in most cases To help prevent similar situations in the future make it a habit to come clean with mistakes as soon as they happen rather than waiting with bated breath for them to be found out "",""url"":""fulltimenanny blog what should a nanny do if her boss is upset with

of their original tip sheet In the works here at Washington s Green Grocer is a switch from plastic bags although we use as few as we can get away with while still keeping your produce from getting battered on it s way to you to only recyclable paper and reuseable cloth bags How to Store Vegetables without Plastic Artichokes place in an airtight container sealed with light moisture Asparagus place them loosely in a glass or bowl upright with water at room temperature Will keep for a week outside the fridge Avocados place in a paper bag at room temp To speed up their ripening place an apple in the bag with them Arugula arugula like lettuce should not stay wet Dunk in cold water and spin or lay flat to dry Place dry arugula in an open container wrapped with a dry towel to absorb any extra moisture Basil is difficult to store well Basil does not like the cold or to be wet for that matter The best method here is an airtight container jar loosely packed with a small damp piece of paper inside left out on a cool counter Beans shelling open container in the fridge eat ASAP Some recommend freezing them if not going to eat right away Beets cut the tops off to keep beets firm be sure to keep the greens by leaving any top on root vegetables draws moisture from the root making them loose flavor and firmness Beets should be washed and kept in and open container with a wet towel on top Beet greens place in an airtight container with a little moisture Broccoli place in an open container in the fridge or wrap in a damp towel before placing in the fridge Broccoli Rabe left in an open container in the crisper but best used as soon as possible Brussels Sprouts If bought on the stalk leave them on that stalk Put the stalk in the fridge or leave it on a cold place If they re bought loose store them in an open container with a damp towel on top Cabbage left out on a cool counter is fine up to a week in the crisper otherwise Peel off outer leaves if they start to wilt Cabbage might begin to loose its moisture after a week so best used as soon as possible Carrots cut the tops off to keep them fresh longer Place them in closed container with plenty of moisture either wrapped in a damp towel or dunk them in cold water every couple of days if they re stored that long Cauliflower will last a while in a closed container in the fridge but they say cauliflower has the best flavor the day it s bought Celery does best when simply places in a cup or bowl of shallow water on the counter Celery root Celeriac wrap the root in a damp towel and place in the crisper Corn leave unhusked in an open container if you must but corn really is best eaten sooner then later for maximum flavor Cucumber wrapped in a moist towel in the fridge If you re planning on eating them within a day or two after buying them they should be fine left out in a cool room Eggplant does fine left out in a cool room Don t wash it eggplant doesn t like any extra moisture around its leaves For longer storage place loose in the crisper Fava beans place in an air tight container Fennel if used within a couple days after it s bought fennel can be left out on the counter upright in a cup or bowl of water like celery If wanting to keep longer than a few days place in the fridge in a closed container with a little water Garlic store in a cool dark place Green garlic an airtight container in the fridge or left out for a day or two is fine best before dried out Greens remove any bands twist ties etc most greens must be kept in an air tight container with a damp cloth to keep them from drying out Kale collards and chard even do well in a cup of water on the counter or fridge Green beans they like humidity but not wetness A damp cloth draped over an open or loosely closed container Green Tomatoes store in a cool room away from the sun to keep them green and use quickly or they will begin to color Herbs a closed container in the fridge to kept up to a week Any longer might encourage mold Lettuce keep damp in an airtight container in the fridge Leeks leave in an open container in the crisper wrapped in a damp cloth or in a shallow cup of water on the counter just so the very bottom of the stem has water Okra doesn t like humidity So a dry towel in an airtight container Doesn t store that well best eaten quickly after purchase Onion store in a cool dark and dry place good air circulation is best so don t stack them Parsnips an open container in the crisper or like a carrot wrapped in a damp cloth in the fridge Potatoes like garlic and onions store in cool dark and dry place such as a box in a dark corner of the pantry a paper bag also works well Radicchio place in the fridge in an open container with a damp cloth on top Radishes remove the greens store separately so they don t draw out excess moisture from the roots and place them in a open container in the fridge with a wet towel placed on top Rhubarb wrap in a damp towel and place in an open container in the refrigerator Rutabagas in an ideal situation a cool dark humid root cellar or a closed container in the crisper to keep their moisture in Snap peas refrigerate in an open container Spinach store loose in an open container in the crisper cool as soon as possible Spinach loves to stay cold Spring onions Remove any band or tie and place in the crisper Summer Squash does fine for a few days if left out on a cool counter even after cut Sweet peppers Only wash them right before you plan on eating them as wetness decreases storage time Store in a cool room to use in a couple a days place in the crisper if longer storage needed Sweet Potatoes Store in a cool dark well ventilated place Never refrigerate sweet potatoes don t like the cold Tomatoes Never refrigerate Depending on ripeness tomatoes can stay for up to two weeks on the counter To hasten ripeness place in a paper bag with an apple Turnips remove the greens store separately same as radishes and beets store them in an open container with a moist cloth Winter squash store in a cool dark well ventilated place Many growers say winter squashes get sweeter if they re stored for a week or so before eaten Zucchini does fine for a few days if left out on a cool counter even after cut Wrap in a cloth and refrigerate for longer storage HOW TO STORE FRUIT WITHOUT PLASTIC Apples store on a cool counter or shelf for up to two weeks For longer storage in a cardboard box in the fridge Citrus store in a cool place with good airflow never in an air tight container Apricots on a cool counter to room temperature or fridge if fully ripe Cherries store in an airtight container Don t wash cherries until ready to eat any added moisture encourages mold Berries Don t forget they re fragile When storing be careful not to stack too many high a single layer if possible A paper bag works well only wash before you plan on eating them Dates dryer dates like Deglet Noor are fine stored out on the counter in a bowl or the paper bag they were bought in Moist dates like Medjool need a bit of refrigeration if they re going to be stored over a week either in cloth or a paper bag as long as it s porous to keeping the moisture away from the skin of the dates Figs Don t like humidity so no closed containers A paper bag works to absorb excess moisture but a plate works best in the fridge up to a week un stacked Melons uncut in a cool dry place out of the sun up to a couple weeks Cut melons should be in the fridge an open container is fine Nectarines similar to apricots store in the fridge is okay if ripe but best taken out a day or two before you plan on eating them so they soften to room temperature Peaches and most stone fruit refrigerate only when fully ripe More firm fruit will ripen on the counter Pears will keep for a few weeks on a cool counter but fine in a paper bag To hasten the ripening put an apple in with them Persimmon Fuyu shorter pumpkin shaped store at room temperature Hachiya longer pointed end room temperature until completely mushy The astringentness of them only subsides when they are completely ripe To hasten the ripening process place in a paper bag with a few apples for a week check now and then but don t stack they get very fragile when really ripe Pomegranates keep up to a month stored on a cool counter Strawberries Don t like to be wet Do best in a paper bag in the fridge for up to a week Check the bag for moisture every other day so you've got all these great fruits and vegetables and now we're going to help you keep them at their freshest with these

influence and possibly everything that your nutritionists cardiologists and mamas warn you about There I was like most people with a pulse enjoying the heck out of some Nutella on a slice of bread at my in laws last weekend and I thought you know what would make this even better Peanut butter I mean is there any question that the combination of peanut butter and chocolate is at the very center of American hearts gullets and junk food aisles And then I thought But it s January You re getting in a bathing suit in a month This is terrible idea But then I reasoned Well it s not like I have to eat more than a spoonful Surely it s possible so exercise some self control around chocolate and peanuts Guys I m really funny sometimes aren t I So I started looking at recipes for homemade Nutella pardon me the non trademark protected gianduja paste which is the smooth and shiny combination of hazelnuts and cocoa loved all over the world I was surprised to find approaches as well all over the map Some used honey some began with a caramel but two techniques in particular caught my eye one in which ground nuts were mixed with just cocoa sugar and oil quite close to the ingredient list of jarred Nutella and a very simple one from Martha Stewart which relied on sweetened condensed milk for its body I decided to make the Martha version second but never got there because my mother who was hanging out for the afternoon and I never got our spoons out of the food processor bowl from the first batch long enough to even consider if it was less than perfect Needless to say I m recommending the first method which is to roast peanuts or toast them further if they re already roasted and then liquefy in them in a food processor Yes liquefy that word came up in a few recipes I thought these writers were taking literary license Sure enough if you keep grinding beyond the paste that you re usually trying to avoid when cooking with ground nuts eventually it becomes a puddle and peanuts with their high oil content even more so It was sloshing and splashing up the sides of the food processor before I added cocoa powdered sugar and salt and some oil to smooth it out and lo and behold peanutella I don t need to tell you what happened next do I One year ago Tomato Sauce with Onion and Butter and Ricotta MuffinsTwo years ago Mushroom Bouguignon and Smashed Chickpea SaladThree years ago Fried ChickenFour years ago Grapefruit Yogurt Cake Chocolate Peanut Spread Peanutella Adapted from a bunch of sources but closest to this from the LA Times To say what is probably obvious peanut qualities range Cocoa qualities range Salt preferences range Flavor preferences range This is an easily tweaked recipe I ended up using a bit more sugar than I d expected and more oil as in I d expected not to need as much as usually suggested due to the high fat content in peanuts but still used three tablespoons I wanted more salt and wished I d found better peanuts to start with but you know a balmy high of 20 degrees this weekend doesn t exactly motivate one to hunt down the best ingredients I can assure you that this is no less loved despite it s average peanut base and no more likely to only be eaten in the moderate spoonfuls promised Oops Probably makes 1 3 4 cups but it was down to a scant 1 1 2 cups before I bothered to gauge the volume 2 cups shelled and skinned raw peanuts1 2 cup of your darkest richest unsweetened cocoa powder1 1 4 cups powdered sugar1 4 teaspoon salt plus additional to taste I used an extra 1 8 teaspoon 3 tablespoons peanut oil Heat the oven to 400 degrees Spread the peanuts evenly over a cookie sheet and roast until they darken about 10 minutes rattling them around a bit halfway through to they toast evenly If you like me were unable to find raw peanuts just toast them for a 5 minutes to deepen their flavor Transfer the peanuts to a food processor and grind them for about 5 minutes First they ll become a paste and will cause any toddler in your midst to have a meltdown from the ruckus Then they ll become more of a paste and finally they ll liquefy Scrape down the sides as needed Add the cocoa sugar salt and two tablespoons of the oil to the food processor and continue to process until well blended about 1 minute Add more salt if needed Add the last tablespoon of oil if the consistency seems too thick Store in refrigerator up to a week in a covered container When it is full chilled like peanut butter it will become thick and swipe with a teaspoon will leave a telltale impression Look I m just warning you okay See more

ET Syrian tanks have stormed the northern city of Hama killing at least 45 civilians a leading rights group says Residents reported heavy shelling and warned that hospitals were overflowing with the dead and wounded The government said that armed groups had burnt police stations and vandalised property Gunmen killed two Syrian soldiers it added US officials have described the events as full on warfare by the Syrian government against its own people The assault was a last act of utter desperation by the Syrian government JJ Harder press attache at the American embassy in Damascus told the BBC With this latest assault the authorities are sending a clear message that they will not tolerate large scale unrest ahead of the month of Ramadan when protests are expected to grow says the BBC s Lina Sinjab in the capital Damascus But our correspondent says the people of Hama remain defiant with some still out in streets shouting We will not be killed again a reference to the 1982 massacre which left tens of thousands dead after President Bashar al Assad s father Hafez sent in troops to quell an Islamist uprising there The recent protests calling for widespread democratic reforms and political freedoms show no sign of letting up despite a government crackdown that has brought international condemnation and sanctions Continue reading the main story Analysis In recent weeks Hama has slid virtually out of government control with as many as 500 000 people the majority of the population taking to the streets After ringing the city for the past month the troops and tanks have gone in to try and tame it Hama has taken on almost iconic status and events there will be followed closely not just in Syria but internationally Earlier this month the US and French ambassadors broke protocol to visit the city and express their solidarity Washington called for Syrian troops to be pulled back The Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan who has been monitoring Syria closely from the outset and urging President Assad to enact serious reforms has insisted there must not be another Hama He was referring to the 1982 repression in which as many as 30 000 people may have been killed when an Islamist uprising in Hama was ruthlessly put down Activists say more than 1 500 civilians and 350 security personnel have been killed across Syria since protests began in mid March Centre of protests Hama has been in a state of revolt and virtually besieged for the past month According to activists on the ground troops and tanks began their multi pronged assault at dawn smashing through hundreds of barricades erected by locals to reach the centre of Hama Tanks are firing their heavy machineguns randomly and overrunning makeshift road blocks a doctor in Hama told Reuters by phone with machinegun fire in the background He said the death toll was rising rapidly adding that three of the city s hospitals had received 24 bodies 19 three and two respectively Speaking in London Rami Abdel Rahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the latest toll based on his contacts with Syrian doctors was 45 dead and several more wounded Some residents said they saw bodies lying in the streets and that electricity and water supplies had been cut Security forces snipers were reported to have taken up positions on high buildings the BBC s Jim Muir reports from Beirut in neighbouring Lebanon One local activist said that five tanks had been abandoned by their crews in two parts of town and that protesters had attacked and burnt down three police stations our correspondent says Please turn on JavaScript Media requires JavaScript to play Another Hama resident told the BBC World Service that the three main hospitals had run out of blood supplies after being overwhelmed by numbers of wounded people They are treating people in the halls of the hospitals A lot of injured people have been taken to homes and doctors are treating them there he told the World Today programme State of terror He said the protesters had done nothing to provoke the military action For three months Hama has had huge demonstrations More than 250 people have been killed and nothing no shot has come out from Hama people Just barricades and stones and wood that s all he said It s just a 100 civilian uprising A Syrian government spokeswoman defended the military operation saying that the authorities were forced to act because Hama had been in a state of terror for the past month There are barricades and roadblocks everywhere People can t go to work they can t sit exams it is simply not acceptable Reem Haddad told the al Jazeera television channel Elsewhere on Sunday three people were killed by security forces at Harak in the southern Deraa region and six in the eastern city of Deir al Zour and rights campaigner Rami Abdel Rahman said On Saturday troops shot dead three people who threw stones at a military convoy sent to quash the near daily protests in Deir al Zour he said A total of 20 people were killed and 35 wounded on Friday as hundreds of thousands of protested in cities across Syria rights groups said More than 500 people were arrested in a single operation in the Qadam neighbourhood of the capital Damascus they added Since the start of the unrest more than 12 600 have been arrested and 3 000 others are reported missing The government blames armed Islamist gangs for the unrest but correspondents say the protests appear largely peaceful with only isolated cases of residents arming themselves against the military assault Most foreign media is banned from the country making it difficult to verify reports Syria s anti government protests inspired by events in Tunisia and Egypt first erupted in mid March after the arrest of a group of teenagers who spray painted a revolutionary slogan on a wall The protests soon spread and human rights activists and opposition groups say 1 700 people have died in the turmoil while thousands more have been injured Although the arrest of the teenagers in the southern city of Deraa first prompted people to take to the streets unrest has since spread to other areas including Hama Homs Latakia Jisr al Shughour and Baniyas Demonstrators are demanding greater freedom an end to corruption and increasingly the ousting of President Bashar al Assad President Assad s government has responded to the protests with overwhelming military force sending tanks and troops into at least nine towns and cities In Deraa and Homs where protests have persisted amateur video footage shows tanks firing on unarmed protesters while snipers have been seen shooting at residents venturing outside their homes Some of the bloodiest events have taken place in the northern town of Jisr al Shughour In early June officials claimed 120 security personnel were killed by armed gangs however protesters said the dead were shot by troops for refusing to kill demonstrators As the military moved to take control of the town thousands fled to neighbouring Turkey taking refuge in camps Although the major cities of Damascus and Aleppo have seen pockets of unrest and some protests it has not been widespread due partly to a heavy security presence There have been rallies in the capital one with an enormous Syrian flag in support of President Assad who still receives the backing of many in Syria s middle class business elite and minority groups The Assad family has been in power for 40 years with Bashar al Assad inheriting office in 2000 The president has opened up the economy but has continued to jail critics and control the media He is from the minority Alawite sect an offshoot of Shia Islam but the country s 20 million people are mainly Sunni The biggest protests have been in Sunni majority areas Although the US and EU have condemned the violence and imposed sanctions the UN Security Council has been unable to agree on a response Some fear the country could descend into civil war if the government collapsed while others believe chaos in Syria with its strategic location and its web of regional alliances could destabilise the entire Middle East BACK current of total NEXT syrian tanks storm the city of hama, killing at least 45 people, a rights group says, as residents report \""intense gunfire\"" and chaos at hospitals."",""url"":""bbc co uk news world

kids are just getting old enough for sleepovers They live close enough to their cousins to visit but far enough away that they don t see them often enough When they get together it is one crazy good time so my sister in law and I put our heads together to let the good times roll No doubt about it A slumber party was in order When I was a kid sleepovers were about junk food staying up late playing games and talking about boys stuff This slumber party was no different except for the part where we talked about boys stuff To make things fun and easy I threw together a great menu full of snacks to keep these kiddos on a sugar high energized until it was way past their bedtime Side note I must emphasize before I get bombarded by people complaining about how all these sweets and snacks are bad for my children and how dare I feed them such garbage yadda yadda yadda this happens a handful of times a year Relax As a parent I got to enjoy the slumber party from a different angle and was also able to see how much work goes on behind the scenes Snacks were the easy part Cleanup now that s another story Luckily the wonderful folks from Electrolux make one part of clean up easy The laundry Right now Electrolux in partnership with Kelly Ripa are hosting a Virtual Sleepover For every person who joins in on the fun Electrolux will donate 1 to the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund That s well and good you say but what does it have to do with my laundry Well when you join the sleepover you will not only have access to fabulous ideas and recipes for your own sleepover you will also be entered to win a new Perfect Steam Washer and Dryer from Electrolux With a wash time of 15 minutes and dry time of 14 minutes I could definitely use a set four boys hello Before you head over to sign up for the Virtual Sleepover I ve shared a few snacks below that we love including the aptly name Smore s Supreme which happened to be named by my adorable niece at the party Graham cracker crust chocolate chip cookie more chocolate and marshmallows Need I say more It was the perfect treat for our little indoor campout Breakfast is also a snap if you prepare ahead My breakfast menu included a

1 4 cracker in the corner Set aside To make the chocolate chip cookie dough begin by melting the butter either in the microwave or stove top Allow to cool slightly and whisk in both sugars eggs and vanilla In a separate medium bowl mix together flour baking soda and salt Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with a spoon Fold in the chocolate chips Press the cookie dough into the baking dish lined with graham crackers I found that pressing it out onto a piece of plastic wrap and then flipping it onto the graham crackers worked great Bake for 20 23 minutes in a 350 oven or until the cookie dough is slightly browned and set Immediately top with the 5 Hershey s Chocolate bars which will begin to melt and top with the marshmallows Set the oven to broil and broil until the marshmallows are toasted on top Watch closely because this only took mere seconds for me Allow to cool cut into bars and serve Use a sharp knife or you will be fighting with the marshmallows 1 3http

now"",""body"":""The earthquake that took place one year ago today in Haiti demonstrates more than ever that the two nations that simply co exist on the island of Hispaniola need to forge closer economic ties In fact there is no solution that builds long term prosperity in Haiti that does not focus on the relationship between the political and commercial elites of Haiti and the Dominican Republic Haiti is weaker than ever before Billions of dollars of aid never showed up The promise of charity paralyzed decision makers even as some NGOs bulge at the seams with cash and lick their chops American development professionals wait for their orders from politicians who exhausted themselves by preening for the press The challenges grow worse every day There are unconfirmed numbers showing that unemployment in Haiti is at least seventy percent Inter American Development Bank President Luis Alberto Moreno told me The country needs immediate low skilled jobs more than anything else Hispaniola is about to become Survivor Island The D R has shed almost 100 000 textile jobs since 2000 because labor is too expensive compared to China The CAFTA D R agreement with the United States mandates that all textiles need to have U S raw materials to be allowed into the U S with low tariffs which prevents them from being able to compete As a result in 2007 the D R exported USD 1 4bn in textiles and in 2009 that number shrank to USD 900mm Harvard s Marcela Escobari says It should be a marriage made in heaven Haiti has lower salaries than China and under the HOPE Act they can source fabrics from anywhere in the world at half price of what the D R can and still export it to the U S with low tariffs This makes a lot of sense especially in light of the fact that a short time ago FoxConn the world s largest electronics manufacturer announced that it was raising wages by over 30 at its largest facilities in Southern China where it makes the Apple iPad and iPhones And according to most analysts this trend will continue throughout the so called special economic zones in China Pierre Marie Boisson a Harvard trained Haitian bank director says It s logical to have a single island economy but under current circumstances the complete integration or one island economy scenario is unlikely politically He adds What we are facing is free trade at best in that case the two economies great disparities create a great risk of trade diversion as opposed to the desirable trade creation Trade diversion simply means that a lot of the products that Haiti currently imports from other countries would be imported from the D R Boisson says But Haiti itself would only marginally benefit primarily because of existing impediments to business investment we can t liberalize trade without greatly improving Haiti s competitiveness Here is how it might work The Dominican Republic runs 56 successful free trade zones in the country most of them private they are islands of efficiency and provide a world class industrial environment We need to deploy know how to a new Special Zone on the frontier between Haiti and the D R where the U S validates the HOPE act and the D R allows controlled legal immigration The factories currently closing could hire Haitians who are hard working and combine this with the institutional strength on Dominican soil Escobari suggests Haiti D R could create incentives to get Dominican entrepreneurs to create microcosms of efficiency and security in Haiti and provide them the political and institutional support to help them succeed Business strategist Rob Henning insists The model already exists at the Codevi Free Zone near Ouanaminthe Grupo M from the D R merged its technical expertise with Haiti s labor and market access to the U S This combines the lowest cost labor in the hemisphere with only 2 5 days transit time to Miami There are few occasions as good as this one where the public and private sectors working towards a common vision could quickly alter the fate of a fragile country Should the wage pressure in China continue China would no longer be a low cost producer in many lower value added industries such as textiles and apparel This presents a significant opportunity for the Dominican Republic Haiti and other countries in the region The logic of co production where textile plants in the Dominican Republic with D R CAFTA benefits combined with sewing operations in Haiti with preferential market access under HOPE and HELP legislation could achieve world class efficiencies All Haitians benefit if co production special zones and the inevitability of free trade and integration encourages Haiti to put its house in order and adopt an effective investment led growth agenda Boisson warns us Having a market of 20 million instead of 10 million people can only stimulate investment job creation and prosperity But we need to make sure that it is done for the benefit of the 20 million island inhabitants and not for the 10 million living in the D R and a handful of Haiti s richest businessmen Unless and until the administration of President Obama applies pressure on Haiti and the Dominican Republic to create a common market to foster human initiative and spur innovation Hispaniola will deteriorate into Survivor Island Even President Pr\u00e9val expressed to me that what Haiti needs is not just a reconstruction but also a refoundation a complete change in its strategies institutions and the mindset of its political and commercial elites Michael Fairbanks is an author and

superstar Rafael Nadal s expense when she imitated his dramatic leg cramp performance at his own press conference the day before The 21 year old took a lot of heat for her so called disrespect but it was obvious she was just having a little fun A sense of humor is sexy and being an oversensitive complainer who is allergic to fun is not 48 Chris Kluwe Takes a Stand for All Idiot Kickers NFL punters kickers take a lot of flack for not being real football players but like it or not they provide a service that is as valuable if not more than the majority of the real players on the team Perhaps it s in the interest of self preservation but most kickers tend to stick to the seen and not heard code of conduct expected of them Vikings punter Chris Kluwe was much the same way until failed NFL receiver Nate Jackson who scored less points in his entire NFL career than some kickers score in a single game had the nerve to suggest publicly on Deadspin com that he was nothing more than a scrawny turncoat whose main purpose is to serve as a sacrificial meal to the real players in the event of a plane crash Jackson probably expected him to slink away with his tail between his legs but Kluwe took a stand for World of Warcraft playing nerds everywhere and absolutely eviscerated Jackson less than 24 hours later publicly on Deadspin com with the biting wit and pitch perfect sarcasm of someone who never bowed down to a bully in his entire life Swoon 47 Alexander Ovechkin Lands Maria Kirilenko Capitals slumping superstar Alexander Ovechkin might not be the best looking guy in any

bigger than he used to be If you see him with his shirt and stuff off he s development into a man His shirt and stuff off Well I guess we re going to have to take Manuel s word on that one but

Elected to Public Office Kelli Gillispie plays corner and defensive end for the Minnesota Valkyrie of the Lingerie Football League When she s not cracking skulls in the LFL Gillispie who owns her own business is also a City Council member serving the good people of Mound Minnesota The first year council woman and former gymnast makes no apologies to those who want to talk crap about the LFL s required uniform and why should she Girl looks good Politics could use more Kelli Gillispies and way less Newt Gingriches and Anthony Weiners 39 ESPN Hires Lindsay Czarniak When they hired Lindsay Czarniak ESPN continued their tradition of find the best of the best beautiful blonde sports broadcaster this country has to offer The beloved Czarniak is sorely missed in Washington D C but the national capital s loss is the nation s gain Unlike the painfully awkward Sara Walsh and boring as crap Charissa Thompson the competent and confident Czarniak already seems at home on the network and despite some early nerves has the best chance to rise to Erin Andrews status 38 Rex Michelle Ryan Fetish Video Scandal Just four days before Christmas 2010 DeadSpin com reported that Jets head coach Rex Ryan and wife Michelle may or may not be in the habit of making amateur foot fetish videos and posting them on the Internet Well it turns out they were The whole foot thing may or may not be your thing but you gotta give the Ryan s props for keeping things spicy 37 Anna Kournikova Gets a Job Despite only achieving marginal success as a tennis player over a decade ago the alluring Anna Kournikova has remained one of the most desired women in the world There may be new crop of dazzling tennis beauties to admire but a suddenly employed Kournikova s new gig on NBC s The Biggest Loser means that she isn t going anywhere 36 Brian Wilson s Spandex Tuxedo San Francisco Giants relief picture donned a spandex tuxedo white gloves an orange bow tie sweet shades and a cane for the 2011 ESPY awards Even if you don t think his whole look is sexy you re wrong you have to appreciate the confidence it takes to go anywhere in head to toe spandex 35 Kristin Cavallari Short Lived Stint on DWTS The future Mrs Jay Cutler and least for now Kristin Cavallari put on her dancing shoes and shook her assets on Season 13 of ABC s Dancing with the Stars and she looked mighty fine doing it Unfortunately she was eliminated in just week three of the competition an inexplicable five weeks before CNN s Nancy Grace 34 Los Angeles Tempation Win Lingerie Bowl The Lingerie Football League s Los Angeles Temptation won the second biggest football championship held on February 6 2011 The event was a hard hitting battle that certainly beats the crap out of the puppy bowl and don t even get me started on how much women playing football in their underwear is that being subjected to the The Black Eyed Peas Also I d like to add that as a Steelers fan it was the only positive memory of an otherwise very drunken angry day of trying to start fights with strangers 33 Erin Andrews Takes Gatorade Bath with RGIII The time honored Gatorade bath after an important victory got a lot sexier in late November when ESPN s and national treasure Erin Andrews was caught in the path of Gatorade meant for Baylor quarterback Robert Griffin III following their upset of Oklahoma Naturally Andrews took it like the champ she is and smiled through the whole ordeal despite being drenched on live television 32 Alexa Flutie Becomes a Patriots Cheerleader Undersized underdog quarterback Doug Flutie spent some of his best days playing football in New England both with the Patriots and his alma mater Boston College Flutie s smokin hot daughter Alexa is his biggest fan and now a rookie cheerleader for the New England Patriots 31 Terrell Owens Works out Without a Shirt Free agent wide receiver Terrell Owens October 25th workout might not have impressed any NFL teams but it impressed the rest of us mortals The general consensus on ESPN seemed to be that the aged rabble rousing Owens wasn t going to attract much interest from NFL teams given his sordid history and recent injury but that he had a bright future as an underwear model I concur Doing sit ups in the driveway does a body good 30 Tiki Barber s Fiance Takes It off for Maxim There isn t much to like about retired Giants running back Tiki Barber He bailed early on a successful NFL career for a pathetically short lived career in broadcasting the highlight of which was dumping his pregnant with twins wife of a decade for a 23 year old NBC intern Traci Lynn Johnson is quite a sight but it says a lot about Tiki Barber that the best thing about him is a home wrecking 23 year old bimbo with bad enough taste in men to marry Tiki Barber 29 Josefine Oqvist Jersey Swap During the 2011 FIFA Women s World Cup Swedish soccer stunner Josefine Oqvist made hearts race when she made her way to the stands to swap jerseys with a lucky fan after Sweden defeated North Korea 1 0 Oqvist even let him knock her a little kiss on the cheek before heading back to the field to rejoin her teammates I guess we know what story that guy will be recounting to his great grand children 28 Brooklyn Decker Lindsey Vonn at the ESPYs Even in micro mini dresses on their own Lindsey Vonn and Brooklyn Decker would have struggled to pull the spotlight from Brian Wilson s spandex tuxedo However when you put the two of them together it s a totally different story When Andy Roddick s better half presented Lindsey Vonn the 2011 ESPY for Best Female Athlete the two embraced in their micro minis and it was the only time all night that there wasn t a single pair of eyes on the spandex tuxedo 27 Mark Sanchez in GQ The jury is still out on his football acumen but this much we know New York Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez is a handsome man a very handsome man Sanchize s handsomeness obviously hasn t gone unnoticed by the editors of GQ magazine who featured him on the cover of the August 2011 issue Sanchize was featured shirtless on the football field shirtless at the beach with a model and shirtless in a bathtub flexing the guns Someone at GQ knows what the ladies like that s for sure 26 Cowboys Cheerleader Kelsi Gets the Game Ball In mid November 2011 Bills wide receiver David Nelson made quite a big production of giving a game ball and a hug to his girlfriend Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader Kelsi Reich after scoring Buffalo s first touchdown of the game Sure the Cowboys were killing the Bills but Nelson wouldn t let a little something like losing badly prevent his romantic grand gesture 25 Minka Kelly Kisses Co Star Rachel Taylor Yankees slugger Derek Jeter s on again allegedly girlfriend actress Minka Kelly doesn t need to show up somewhere with her man to get people talking In mid October 2011 a then Jeterless Kelly sent the Internet abuzz when she was photographed in a less than platonic looking smooch with then Charlie s Angels co star Rachael Taylor Nobody knows why the pair were kissing but there was speculation that it was an attempt to help boost the ratings of their now cancelled show Well it didn t work and although the uninspired CBS reboot was temporary this photo is forever 24 Rob Ryan s Inspiration Is Diora Baird In September 2011 Dallas Cowboys defensive coordinator Rob Ryan proved he wasn t the only Ryan brother with a lust for life and other things Ryan was spotted on the sidelines with a defensive play chart that included a photo of Guess model Diora Baird for additional inspiration It seems to be working The Cowboys won that game and now look to be on pace to win their division and maybe even compete in the playoffs That is if Romo doesn t pull a Romo 23 Eagles Cheerleader Stephanie Smith at Home with Esquire Like former WWE Diva Stacy Keibler Philadelphia Eagles Cheerleader Stephanie Smith was among those featured in Esquire s Me in My Place series Smith modeled her cheerleading uniform baked cupcakes in her underwear and lounged seductively on her bed for the camera Ms Stephanie revealed that that she s a P90X fanatic who likes to dance in the mirror with the blinds open when she s putting on her uniform just to make sure she looks her best Wondering if all that is authentic Smith who has good taste in sitcoms had this to say They re real and they re spectacular Indeed 22 Rafael Nadal for Armani Emporio Armani sure knows how to hire people who look amazing in underwear Soccer players David Beckham with wife Victoria and Cristiano Ronaldo have both shilled in their skivvies for Armani in the past In 2011 tennis superstar Rafael Nadal and seductive sexpot actress Meghan Fox joined the Armani army and produced some of the hottest ads yet Which is obviously no small feat if you ve seen Beckham s ads in particular 21 ESPN s Annual Body Issue ESPN The Magazine s annual Body Issue should really be released in December because the whole thing feels like Christmas for anyone who likes sports and or nudity The 2011 Body Issue didn t disappoint and had a little something for everyone Rams running back Stephen Jackson and L A Clippers forward Blake Griffin for the ladies and other interested parties and U S women s soccer Hope Solo U S women s gymnast Alicia Sacramone and snowboarder Gretchen Bleiler for the gents and other interested parties 20 Arianny Celeste Is a Virgin In a July 2011 interview with RawVegas tv 26 year old UFC Ring Girl Arianny Celeste said that despite her super sexy image she s still a virgin Hey I don t know if it s true but I certainly can t prove it s not Either way though Celeste who has appeared in Maxim FHM and Playboy knows how to get your attention 19 LSU s Tyrann Mathieu Makes Defense Sexy What s that lame saying Offense is sexy but defense wins championships Something like that although I m sure the shockingly smug and suddenly unlikable Aaron Rodgers would disagree A Rodge opinions aside there s no denying that nothing put asses in the seats like a high flying high scoring offense That s only because LSU s standout sophomore corner Tyrann The Honey Badger Mathieu is still playing in the Bayou It s impossible to predict how Mathieu will perform in the NFL but after two seasons with the Tigers he s got a lot of people believing he s got at least the potential to become one of the biggest play makers in the game 18 Abbey Clancy in Esquire UK British model Abbey Clancy is the wife of footballer Peter Crouch who plays for Stoke City in the Barclay s Premier League Clancy s July 2011 feature in Esquire U K was everything everything you d expect and more from one of the hottest WAGs on the planet Clancy was featured in various positions and states of undress on a lucky motorcycle and in the interview she revealed that she was a horrifically ugly child exaggerated eve roll who dreams of becoming a Victoria s Secret Angel My guess is she isn t the only one who d like to see that happen 17 LFL Bench Clearing Brawl As a woman I can t truly understand the appeal of the catfight All I know is that judging from television and movies men seem to really enjoy them Well if an ordinary run of the mill catfight interests you then a bench clearing brawl between two football teams of lingerie clad women should really interest you In December 2010 the LFL s Tampa Bay Breeze and now defunct Miami Caliente engaged in a bench clearling brawl that trumps that was more entertaining than any brawl Josh Beckett has ever manically beaned his way into It was suggested the whole thing might have been staged but my question is Who cares 16 Erin Andrews Shills for Reebok ESPN anchor and national treasure Erin Andrews deal with Reebok was short lived thanks to the network s ridiculous rules about corporate sponsorships Although perhaps they re only ridiculous when Andrews is involved because nobody wants to see Tony Kornheiser or Skip Bayless anymore than they already have to Andrews deal with Reebok might be a thing of the past but at least we ll have her sexy photo shoot to remember it by 15 Irina Shayk Lands SI Cover The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition might be a little tame for people but we have it to thank for introducing us to some of the hottest women of the last two decades Tyra Banks Heidi Klum Rebecca Romijn Marisa Miller Bar Rafaeli and Brooklyn Decker have all graced the cover On the 2011 cover we were treated to 25 year old Russian Goddess Irina Shayk who you may recognize as the arm candy of footballer Cristiano Ronaldo Here s hoping SI buys American in 2012 and gives the people what they want More Kate Upton to clarify I m not being anti Russian models I m being pro Kate Upton which reminds me 14 Kate Upton Joins Twitter In April 2011 Sport Illustrated Swimsuit Edition s hottest bikini babe and Victoria s Secrets sexiest angel Kate Upton joined Twitter Her sudden appearance on the social networking site is a testament to the vast glories of the information age Upton s top priority was figuring out how to make her background picture something that properly highlighted her boobs She s carried that can do spirit with her and if Upton is someone who appeals to you physically check out her Twitter gallery You owe me big time for this information 13 Vancouver Riots Couple Kiss Vancouver Canucks fans took their team s Game 7 loss to the Boston Bruins in the Stanley Cup finals hard very hard We all know that Canadians love hockey like Germans love David Hasselhoff but the apocalyptic riots that befell Vancouver in the wake of the loss surprised most of us The couple kissing on the street amongst the riots became a global sensation and the photo will likely live on as one of the most iconic photos in sports history 12 Cam Newton s Heisman Smile Embroiled in controversy Auburn s superstar quarterback Cam Newton gave a relatively awkward speech when he accepted the Heisman trophy in December 2010 Today the NCAA pay for play allegations are behind him they found no major violations and nobody even remembers his speech What they do remember is Cam Newton s enthusiasm and his megawatt smile mostly because his rookie success in the NFL is a welcome weekly reminder So far the eye catching Newton has said and done all the right things and is one of the easiest guys in the NFL to root for I for one am looking forward to seeing a lot more of Newton in the future a lot more 11 Paulina Gretzky s Twitter Scandal Apparently The Great One s that s Wayne Gretzky to you hockey neophytes daughter Paulina like her mother Janet has her sights set on some kind of career in the spotlight Unfortunately for the Gretzky s but fortunately for us like many 22 year olds Paulina is under the mistaken impression that the best way to achieve her dreams is by postings hundreds of slutty pictures of herself on the Internet Apparently No 99 had a conversation with his little girl about sullying the family name on Twitter because most of the questionable pictures have been removed Naturally they remain easily accessible on countless sites like BroBible for your viewing pleasure 10 A Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders 2011 Calendar I haven t seen the swimsuit calendar of every cheerleader squad in the NFL although I have seen most but something tells me none of them would disappoint That being said you can count on the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders to knock it out of the park without fail year after year Which is a credit to those aging monsters who run the show down there but since I think it s possible to be great without snickering about cankles or rolling your eyes because a 19 year old girl who wears a size four is too thick they can choke on their credit 10 B Miami Dolphins Cheerleader Swimsuit Fashion Show Most if not all cheerleader squads in the NFL produce their own swimsuit calendar that can be purchased at the games and online As if the calendar weren t gift enough many squads promote their annual calendar with an annual swimsuit fashion show It should come as no surprise that the best bikini centric blowout comes courtesy of the Miami Dolphins Cheerleaders Living in a tropical year round bikini heaven gives them an innate advantage 9 Angela Rypien Not Mark Is the QB in the Family Remember Washington Redskins unlikely Super Bowl winning quarterback Mark Rypien Me either but he exists and this ridiculously hot vision in neon green is his daughter Angela Rypien is the standout rookie quarterback of the LFL s Seattle Mist Angela is a breakout star in the league who if good prevails over evil we ll probably be seeing a lot more of in the future Oh and I m in no position to make this happen but wouldn t she and Cam Newton or Mark Barkley make an adorable fairytale football couple 8 Michelle Beadle Wants to Get What In August 2011 Deadspin com reported on rumors circulating about the behavior of ESPN s Michelle Beadle following the ESPY awards in Los Angeles Beadle didn t dispute that she stopped at a umber of late night parties that night but she does dispute everything else in the report According to the source a sloppy drunk Beadle and a few girlfriends were hanging with Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers when she loudly announced I just wanna get f ed Beadle was allegedly rebuffed by the Super Bowl MVP who was linked to Erin Andrews earlier in the year and had to settle for his teammate Clay Matthews True or not it sounds like quite a night 7 German National Women s Soccer Team in Playboy In order to promote the 2011 FIFA Women s World Cup and dispel the stereotype that female athletes are butch the German National Women s Soccer team posed for German Playboy in June 2011 Well there is probably happy medium between butch and Playmate but their point is well taken and I m not one to mess with perfection 6 Rob Gronkowski Spends Bye Week with Bibi Jones New England Patriots superstar tight end Rob Gronkowski lives a substantially more awesome life than you Gronk has an impressive job washboard abs a bloated bank account and he spent his bye week visiting friends at the University of Arizona his alma mater in Tucson Apparently among his friends in Tucson the city of which he is king is the sexually adventurous Bibi Jones When Ms Jones tweeted a photo of herself donning the jersey of a shirtless and smiling Gronk it became a full on scandal 5 Arianny Celeste Sells Bud Light Lime In June 2011 UFC s virginal Ring Girl Arianny Celeste appeared in this advertisement for Budweiser s disgusting citrus travesty Bud Light Lime Thankfully they aren t even pretending to sell beer in this commercial which features a near naked Celeste sucking on limes and squeezing them on herself while explaining that she likes things physical Listen Bud Light Lime knows it s disgusting but Arianny Celeste likes a man that can go more than one round and opting for Bud Light Lime instead of Jack Daniels on the rocks makes it more likely that you ll be able satisfy her if given the opportunity Even though you won t be given the opportunity 4 Larissa Riquelme Promises to Bare It All for Paraguay We all know that soccer isn t entirely embraced in the United States despite allegedly being the most popular sport on the planet I ve got two words that can change all that Larissa Riquelme In July 2011 Paraguay superfan Larissa Riquelme garnered global attention when she vowed to strip naked again apparently if Paraguay won the Copa America Her beloved Paraguay made it to the finals but unfortunately lost 3 0 to Uruguay who obviously thought nothing of ruining it for the rest of us Some people are so selfish Well here s hoping she s still looking for a reason to take it all off during the 2014 World Cup 3 Jim Harbaugh s Machismo Giants head coach Jim Harbaugh s belly flashing chest bumping exchange with his players after beating the previously undefeated Detroit led to a handshake with a little too much gusto for Lions head coach Jim Schwartz s liking Now we don t know how much juice Harbaugh put into that handshake but either he shakes hands with the manly force of a hungry crocodile or Schwartz is kind of a baby Maybe it s a little of both The media called the whole exchange childish stupid and inappropriate Whatever jerks I called it hot And I m not embarrassed to confess that I looked up Jim Harbaugh s marital status just to rule out that he hasn t been waiting his whole life for a broad like me 2 Seriously Hot Broads Seriously Talkin Sports It was less than a decade ago that women for the most part were relegated to largely useless roles in the sports media There were a couple of ballers doing their thing but do you even want to remember a world before Erin Andrews Thanks to ambition and the internet Andrews isn t the only game in town anymore Miami s Kavita Channe is just one of countless broads building a name for themselves outside the confines of a major television network A Miami sports radio fixture Channe a University of Florida alum has built a massive and devoted sports following on Twitter Facebook and YouTube Channe has interviewed Miami megastars like LeBron James and even brought you a hilarious Baseball Wives spoof six months before it premiered on VH1 1 Kate Upton Does the Dougie Few things in life are guaranteed to make me smile every time without fail than an athlete doing the Dougie Dallas Cowboy Dez Bryant Philadelphia Eagle DeSean Jackson and the man who did it best Washington Wizard John Wall have all captivated with their moves I even enjoyed the rendition of the Detroit Lion s corn fed mid western frat boy backup quarterback Drew Stanton Their moves are boss but you will never see a sexier Dougie than that of busty model Kate Upton It s starts out slow but becomes almost hypnotic as it goes on By the end of this magical performance you don t know which way is up rankings\/list, multiple sports, b\/r swagger, pop culture, partners guilty pleasures so 2011 was kind of a downer overall, right? a presidential primary, an nba lockout and a wicked lame bcs rematch in ncaa football. no thank you... so 2011 was kind of a downer overall, right? a presidential primary, an

"http://www.good.is/post/Stop-Feeding-Your-Garbage-Can/"	"4710"	"{""title"":""Stop Feeding Your Garbage Can "",""body"":""Talking to the chef of America s least wasteful restaurant Of the 350 billion pounds of food produced in America each year we throw away a gut wrenching 98 billion pounds 98 percent of which ends up in landfills According to the EPA landfills are the largest human related source of methane in the United States accounting for 34 percent of all methane emissions Methane from landfills is generated when organic food waste decomposes under anaerobic conditions Our rotting food is therefore a major contributor to global climate change The retail food industry which includes restaurants is responsible for 54 billion pounds of this waste and hemorrhages 44 billion a year in wasted food Fortunately a few chefs are working to reverse this trend Leading the charge against food wastefulness are chef Russ Moore and his wife Allison Hopelain the co owners of Camino a restaurant in Oakland California They recently sat down with GOOD to discuss conservation great food and the steps they take to avoid wasting a single leaf of lettuce or a biodynamic drop of wine GOOD Why is it important for you to use everything RUSS MOORE Everything we use has value Someone harvested it someone grew it someone cared about it Most restaurants buy in bulk they get these cheap standardized products Our carrots come from a farmer and are not all the same size and shape they take longer to work with they require more skill and attention to cook properly These are the best products as far as taste and flavor but also the best in terms of the standards for how they were sustainably raised grown and harvested G Is the recent attention to understanding the entire food process changing how you cook RM I should stress that nothing is new here This is all really old It is classic French style it s how you were supposed to use all of the food you had available Using everything is a challenge and part of being a chef It s part of what you are supposed to do G What are some ways to maximize your ingredients RM If I cook a vegetable in water I m not going to throw away that water That vegetable has imparted great flavor so I ll use the juices and extracts left over from say my artichoke water Maybe I m baking an egg with cardoons and mushrooms I know that my little bit of artichoke juice from the left over water will make sense with that egg so I take a cazuela a Spanish clay dish add olive oil and the leftover juice and then put the egg on top I cook it in the fire baking the egg from above in the air and below in the liquid Eggs are precious We can t get as many of the Soul Food farm eggs in the winter so we have to use them all well Say you need egg yokes to make a mayonnaise most places just throw the egg whites away We ll use the whites to make a meringue or give them to the bartenders to make frothy drinks G How does this waste conscious process impact your planning RM We change the menu when we have a lot of something left and we try to manage the ebb and flow of extra ingredients with creative recipes We break down whole pigs ourselves and render all the scraps Recently we had too much lard I wasn t going to use any other fat until I used this up so we put it in seasonal cookies and donuts and the house sauerkraut It s not just the lard of course We ll make rillette we ll bread and fry the head and trotters feet and make fritters Tonight we ll boil pig tongues confit some turnip greens and smear them on toast G Do you repurpose other animal proteins the same way you maximize a whole pig RM Yes with ducks We do our potatoes cooked in duck fat Some restaurants buy duck fat that s a crime against humanity a crime against ducks If you buy a whole duck there is so much extra fat that you can easily render and save The duck is just rich in resources Take the giblets Salt them cook them confit in their own rendered fat and they can last for 6 months G How do restaurants reconcile cost versus quality versus effort Is there more to the mathematics of planning a menu this way RM Lots of restaurants buy cheap processed meat or pork that s already broken down It costs pennies in real life but the taste isn t good and I don t want to miss out on the other stuff you get with the entire animal the bones and the offal Also you should make sauces for the meat you are cooking with the bones and parts of that same animal As a restaurant you either have to buy cheaper stuff or maximize every part of everything you are buying We consider pork per pound and consider each pound equally We don t differentiate the value of say pork bone or pork head from filet or loin or shoulder We use all of it and we cook all of it We use all of it every time G How do you avoid tossing the typical scraps of fruits and vegetables RM We use a lot of stuff that usually gets thrown away For example we make herb jam from the discarded lettuce leaves fennel the tougher outer parts of our greens the lower leaves of an oregano plant we cook them all down together and add garlic cumin and olives and make it into a paste herb jam We take quince apple and peach cores and peals and we make our own infusions of brandy We make our own bitters too because regular bitters are full of preservatives and chemicals We ll use the syrup that is left over from poaching quince or huckleberry or cherries and give it to the bartenders to mix seasonal cocktails or use it in desserts The grapes in our wines are all organic or biodynamic I cooked at Chez Panisse for a long time and was also their produce buyer So I have always needed to appreciate the quality of the products I was buying G What are some of the more innovative ways to avoid waste ALLISON HOPELAIN If people don t finish wine at the bottom of the bottle we ll consolidate all the leftover bottles at the end of the night and pour it into a wood barrel A few months later we have house made red wine vinegar RM Our salt for instance is really expensive many times more expensive than normal salt Most restaurants use kosher salt Ours is a coarse minerally Celtic sea salt and we use it for everything It tastes a lot better and it s better for you so we train the cooks not to throw any of it on the ground not to toss it on oil spills We can only afford it if we don t waste any of it AH It s not just the food Our table is made from a tree that fell down in a storm All the chairs and benches are used church chairs and pews The still and sparkling table water bottles were originally gin bottles from an artisanal distiller after we used the gin we repurposed the bottles We also carbonate our water with a machine so we don t have to use any new water bottles G You cook everything over an enormous wood fire That must consume a lot of wood AH Our firewood is all orchard prunings so they don t have to cut down trees We still use it conservatively the peppers for dinner were all cooked on the embers from brunch G Is conserving food and celebrating the product to this degree something that is unique about Camino RM We didn t open a restaurant just to save and preserve but we don t throw anything away at home either we compost everything It s hard because you have to create a lot of systems and it creates more work But it seems impossible for us not to be doing this If we are going to have this one small restaurant then we think we should be able to do things right and make it a good place not be needlessly wasting anything A lot of it has to do with personal connections with actually going to someone s farm that you know Farmers work harder than us that is hard work We don t want to throw any of that work away someone grew it Someone sloshed around in the dirt and the rain for this food the least we can do is serve it well Photos by Shing Wong talking to the chef of america&#39;s least wasteful restaurant\tof the

weapon you need weapons grade fissile material This could be plutonium or uranium It could theoretically also be something like neptunium or americium but nobody has ever bothered with that as it would be far more difficult In the case of uranium it must be highly enriched uranium and in the case of plutonium it must be weapons grade plutonium The process of extracting plutonium from spent fuel for reprocessing use in fast reactors or MOX fuel usage is similar to that used to extract plutonium for use in nuclear weapons For this reason many nuclear energy opponents will scream AH HA and say that a nuclear power reactor is clearly a proliferation hazard regardless of what type it is Furthermore they ll tell you that reprocessing is the ultimate danger and that if we dare recycling fuel then others will recycle their fuel too many already do by the way and if they do that then certainly they ll be building weapons Of course there are plenty of countries that reprocess fuel to one degree or another and don t have nuclear weapons Germany South Korea Japan Belgium and Italy either reprocess fuel or have done so in the past but never had a nuclear weapon Countries like Russia France and the UK reprocess civilian reactor fuel but have never used this fuel to build a nuclear weapon There s a good reason for this As it turns out the spent fuel from a modern power reactor such as a BWR or PWR reactor is completely unusable for a nuclear weapon Here is why You ve probably heard of the two earliest combat ready nuclear bombs developed by the Manhattan Project Little Boy and Fat Man Little Boy was the codename for the uranium bomb which used a gun triggered design firing a subcritical uranium slug into a subcritical uranium target to produce a supercritical mass Fat Man was the code name for a plutonium based bomb that used a spherical core with a semantically explosives to compress the plutonium resulting in an implosion that would bring the core to critical mass Well here is Thin man the third bomb design that was developed during the Manhattan project the one which never made it past the early test phase To be more accurate those are not nuclear bombs but rather just the empty casings No thin man type bomb was ever built because a combination of laboratory experiments and calculations proved that the design would either not work at all or work so poorly that it wouldn t produce an explosion any larger than a nominal size conventional munition The problem is plutonium or rather an isotope of plutonium plutonium 240 Plutonium is produced by neutron bombarding uranium 238 in a reactor When uranium 238 absorbs a neutron it becomes uranium 239 Uranium 239 has a half life of only 34 minutes and decays to neptunium 239 which has a half life of 2 3 days and decays to plutonium 239 Therefore when uranium 238 is irradiated with neutrons a few days later some of that uranium will have become plutonium 239 which can be separated chemically Plutonium 239 is fissile and it s exactly what you want if you re looking to build a nuclear weapon However there s a problem that comes with the irradiation process During the irradiation period some of that plutonium 239 will also absorb a neutron If that happens it will usually fission but up to a third of the time it won t instead it will become Pu 240 Likewise some of that neptunium 239 will absorb a neutron before it gets a chance to decay to plutonium 239 thus resulting in neptunium 240 which quickly decays to plutonium 240 Because of these reactions any reactor generated plutonium will have some plutonium 240 in it Plutonium 240 is what you do not want when you re building a nuclear weapon For one thing it s not fissile and for another it s highly radioactive four times more so than Pu 239 but what really makes Pu 240 so problematic for weapons use is that it has a high rate of decay by spontaneous fission which produces neutrons The rate of spontaneous fission of Pu 240 is so high that even with a tiny bit in a sample of plutonium it will have significant effects on critical mass If plutonium were used in a gun triggered weapon the spontaneous fission rate would mean that the bomb would begin to fission before the two portions came fully together This is pre initiation and it results in the weapon blowing itself apart before it actually gets a chance to achieve a full blown nuclear reaction It s commonly known as a fizzle To avoid this a much more efficient design would be needed one which could slam the fuel together very quickly and start the reaction before pre initiation could destroy the weapon in a very small explosion This is why the implosion triggered system was designed It proved to be capable producing a reaction from plutonium Although the designers were not as confident about the design leading to the need for a test before deployment something which was not done with the gun triggered uranium bomb Yet even using the implosion design the presence of Pu 240 was still a problem Having some Pu 240 present in the plutonium turned out to be inevitable but it was still necessary to keep it to a minimum If the level of Pu 240 were too high even the implosion design would fail In order to do this a special plutonium breeding cycle needed to be developed The key to producing plutonium that is high in Pu 239 and low in Pu 240 is to make sure that it only spends a short period of time being irradiated Uranium targets in the form of small slugs would be irradiated in a reactor for a period of only one to two months This would allow a small amount of neptunium and thus plutonium to build up but only a small number of the atoms would absorb a second neutron The slug would then be processed to remove the plutonium and the uranium would then be irradiated again once again for a couple of months In practice this meant that the target had to be completely dissolved and reprocessed since that s the only way to extract the plutonium The uranium that was left could be reused but it had to be completely re fabricated into a new target It also required a cool down period to assure the neptunium had all decayed This period of time also eliminated most of the short lived fission byproducts which made the material difficult to handle and complicated the separation process Typically the cool down period would last several weeks Each target would only produce a tiny amount of plutonium so the process had to be repeated thousands of times to accumulate significant amounts of plutonium If the targets had been left in the reactor longer then they d produce more plutonium but more of the plutonium would be Pu 240 the type which needs to be avoided All and all the process of producing weapons grade plutonium yields only about half a pound of plutonium for every ton of uranium irradiated and processed To accomplish this the United States built a truly massive complex at Hanford Washington It took three reactors working full time from 1944 on to produce enough plutonium for the weapons used in 1945 A total of nine plutonium production reactors were built at Hanford and produced plutonium for US nuclear weapons until 1987 Hanford was joined by the Savannah River Site in 1953 Six reactors would be built at the Savannah River site for plutonium production All of the plutonium in US nuclear weapons came from the reactors at Hanford and Savannah River Not one ounce of weapons plutonium ever came from a commercial nuclear power plant Grades of plutonium In current terminology weapons grade plutonium is considered to have roughly 93 Pu 2239 or more while fuel grade or mid grade plutonium has at least 81 and reactor grade contains less than 81 Pu 239 Weapons grade plutonium is considered to be the type well suited for use in nuclear weapons but this does not mean that lower grades can t theoretically be used at least to a point As the concentration of Pu 240 increases the difficulties it presents become greater and greater causing the weapon to become less reliable yield is reduced and a failure becomes more and more likely Advanced weapons designs employ features like neutron reflectors super high velocity highly precise implosion lenses and multi point detonation mechanisms boosted cores and pulse neutron generators These technologies possessed by only a handful of countries could theoretically be used to create a more efficient weapon that could potentially utilize lower grade plutonium but only to a point A highly advanced super efficient weapon could make use of plutonium with a content of 91 Pu 239 or possibly even 88 However much beyond this would be difficult to impossible for even the most advanced weapons This kind of technology would not be available to a country just starting a weapons program anyway The designs used by the United States and Russia are the result of hundreds of tests and decades of intense research They also require exotic materials like tritium However no country with the technology to make such weapons would ever bother using the lower quality plutonium doing so would reduce the weapons yield and make fabrication more difficult Both the US and Russia already have a surplus of old weapons grade plutonium Regardless of whether you could use sub weapons grade plutonium in an effective weapon it still would never work with reactor grade plutonium The reason for this is simple commercial power plants don t produce the kind of high grade low Pu 240 material that is required for weapons The most common type of nuclear reactor used around the world for power generation is the pressurized water reactor In addition to this there are many boiling water reactors in use There are also some heavy water reactors and a few gas cooled reactors in use With a couple of exceptions more on that later these reactors are NOT designed to produce weapons grade material Power reactors are designed to burn their fuel until there isn t much left in it to burn or at least until the fuel no longer efficiently sustains critical mass in the core Utility companies would rather be cranking out gigawatts than shuffling around fuel rods and for this reason most PWR s and BWR s are only refueled every year or two Typically only a portion of the fuel is replaced and each fuel rod is used for more than one refueling interval Most fuel rods spend at least three years in a reactor before being replaced and some spend even longer Some reactor designs allow for online refueling These reactors are often refueled every few months with only one or two fuel assemblies changed each time and fuel rods spending two or more years in the reactor depending on burnup and enrichment The CANDU reactor is refueled in this manner but its spent fuel still spends far more time being irradiated than a weapons plutonium target ever would Because of this the plutonium found in spent fuel from power reactors has a very high concentration of Pu 240 making it unsuitable for use in nuclear weapons The high levels of Pu 240 are not as important when the plutonium is to be reused in reactor fuel Fast reactors will burn Pu 240 without issue and in thermal reactors while plutonium 240 usually requires two neutrons to fission more than Pu 239 this does not preclude its use The pre initiation issues of a weapon do not exist in reactors The plutonium produced by power reactors has yet another issue it contains the isotope plutonium 241 an isotope which is only present in negligible quantities in weapons grade plutonium Pu 241 decays into Am 241 with a half life of only fourteen years Since most reactor spent fuel sits for years in storage by the time it is processed a significant quantity has decayed to Am 241 The combination of Pu 241 and Am 241 makes the material highly radioactive causing potential problems with material irradiation the self irradiation of a weapons core can cause embrittlement and heating of the plutonium pit and potentially compromise the weapons integrity In higher burnup reactors significant quantities of Pu 242 also begin ton build up Plutonium 238 a source of intense heat also can be found in the spent fuel of high burnup reactors and can present problems for weapons us even when present at quantities of less than 1 In a pressurized water reactor s spent fuel only about 53 of the plutonium present is plutonium 239 the type needed for a weapon Creating a weapon out of plutonium with such extremely low levels of the critical isotope is absolutely impossible In face 93 pu 239 is considered the low end of what is generally acceptable for weapons use and would work rather poorly in most weapons designs Countries like the US Russia France and other advanced nuclear weapons states usually use even purer plutonium with concentrations of unwanted isotopes as low as 3 or less The possibility of using power reactors to produce weapons grade plutonium Simply reprocessing the fuel from a power reactor would yield plutonium that is utterly useless for weapons use but could the reactor s fuel cycle be modified to produce higher grade plutonium Perhaps but it wouldn t be easy PWR and BWR reactors are complex to refuel and normally are only refueled on relatively rare occasions every year or so at the most Refueling requires shutting down the reactor allowing it to cool and depressurize opening the lid of the reactor replacing the fuel and finally replacing the lid It takes more than a week to do this during which time the reactor is shut down Producing weapons grade plutonium would mean irradiation cycles as short as a month This would mean the reactor would be shut down almost as much as it was running dramatically compromising its power producing capabilities The cumbersome procedure would be made even worse because of the fact that the fuel assemblies use long cladding rods not the easily processed slugs that weapons reactors use A power reactor of this type might be able to handle a fuel system more favorable to such frequent reprocessing and re fabrication but only with very extensive modification CANDU reactors can be refueled online but the spent fuel they produce is very low in plutonium A CANDU reactor could theoretically be used to produce weapons grade plutonium but again it would require extensive modification of the fuel cycle Fuel would have to be ejected more frequently and doing so would reduce the power output of the reactor Additionally since the breed ratio of a CANDU under normal operation would not produce enough plutonium to make it a viable weapons reactor there would need to be some modification of the fuel likely using some level of enrichment combined with natural or depleted uranium target rods It could be done but like the PWR it wouldn t be especially easy and it would be pretty obvious to the world what you were doing There are two types of power reactors which are designed in a manner that allows them to produce weapons grade plutonium The RBMK and Magnox reactors were both conceived as dual purpose reactors and as such have the features necessary to produce weapons grade plutonium The spent fuel from both of these reactors is useless for weapons production when they are run in a manner that maximizes their efficiency as power reactors but the fuel cycle can be modified in order to produce nuclear weapons However both of these reactors are considered obsolete designs The last Magnox reactor was built in 1971 and will be decommissioned this year Most of the RBMK s built have been decommissioned but a handful are still in operation in Russia a country which has no reason to produce more plutonium for weapons given the enormous unused stockpile they already have A country wishing to produce plutonium based nuclear weapons would be better off building a dedicated reactor or reactors for plutonium breeding That is what every nuclear armed nation has done The difficulties in making a power reactor produce weapons grade material are likely to be greater than simply building a purpose built reactor and in both cases the intentions would be fairly obvious The fuel that comes out of a power reactor is useless for weapons production and therefore could never be spirited away to reprocessing to yield weapons grade material The great deception In 1977 President Jimmy Carter ended the reprocessing of nuclear fuel in the United States thus making the US the only major nuclear nation with no reprocessing of spent fuel at all In doing so he created the nuclear waste problem which prior to the end of reprocessing had been non existent At the time he ordered some very selective information declassified to support this decision As anyone who understands nuclear weapons design would immediately realize that reprocessing of spent fuel absolutely does not yield weapons grade material Carter asserted that in fact weapons grade material was not required to build a nuclear weapon To support this claim he announced that the US had conducted a test in 1962 of a device containing Reactor Grade Plutonium The problem was that Carter lied if only by omission As is mentioned above there s not a single hard line at the 7 concentration Plutonium containing 8 or 9 Pu 240 could certainly be used in a reasonably sophisticated weapon although with reduced yield When the 1962 test was conducted there were only two terms for plutonium grades weapons grade and reactor grade In the contemporary terminology reactor grade plutonium was anything with less than 93 plutonium 239 so a sample with 92 5 would qualify as reactor grade Additional information on the test was released in 1997 The biggest revelation was the source of the plutonium it was not American but was imported from the UK If the US wanted to test how lower grade plutonium would preform in a weapon why not just use plutonium recovered from one of the power reactors in the US After all by 1962 the US had a number of PWR s including Shippingport Yankee Rowe Vallecitos Nuclear Center as well as a number of prototype naval reactors in operation at the Idaho National Laboratory The reason is simple researchers were aware that the plutonium produced by these kind of reactors was so low in Pu 239 that it just plain would not work in a weapon The test was likely intended to assess the effect of using lower grade plutonium in a weapon and confirm theoretical calculations but to do this they needed plutonium that was lower than weapons grade but not by too much or the test would fail completely The DOE has never released the details of exactly what the composition of the plutonium was nor have they released information about what the weapons yield was or whether the weapon incorporated advanced design features The fact that it came from a Magnox reactor however is very telling Note in the graph seen above that of all the power reactor designs the Magnox produces the least Pu 240 in its spent fuel and thus the most Pu 239 This is not by accident as the Magnox reactor was originally designed as a weapons material reactor Magnox reactors that continued to run in recent years produced plutonium with about 18 Pu 240 but this is only because they were operated at a high burnup level to produce power efficiently When Magox reactors first came online they were run at a much shorter fueling interval more similar to the reactors at Savannah River and Hanford Their primary purpose was to produce weapons grade plutonium Electricity was also generated from the reactor s heat but this was seen as a byproduct not the primary function of the reactor The first Magnox reactors became operational in 1956 at Calder Hall at the Stellafield nuclear site The facility operated in a low burnup mode intended for weapons production until 1964 After 1964 the reactors continued to produce weapons grade plutonium intermittently until 1995 The Chapelcross nuclear power station opened in 1959 and was considered the sister plant to the Calder Hall reactors Chapelcross was also intended primarily to produce nuclear weapons material In its early years it ran on natural uranium at a low burnup that produced weapons grade plutonium Berkely station opened in July of 1962 Berkeley was the first nuclear power plant in the UK that was owned by a civilian agency the Central Electricity Generating Board Thus there were only three nuclear reactors in the UK that potentially could have provided plutonium in 1962 Calder Hall can be ruled out because it was known to be operating at full capacity in weapons production mode at the time Thus the material it produced would be considered weapons grade Reports indicate that in its early years Berkeley was also used for producing weapons grade material To this day the British government remains secretive about its historical plutonium breeding capabilities and the level to which Berkely was used to produce nuclear weapons material is not entirely clear Had the material come from Chapplecross it would have represented an abnormally long period of irradiation since Chapplecross was primarily producing weapons material Had it come from Berkeley it would also have had to be low burnup if only because of timing Considering that it takes a good two to three months to cool reprocess and fabricate fresh uranium rods into a weapons pit that would have left only about three months for irradiation at Berkeley even if the test took place in late December of 1962 Since the plant came online in July there wouldn t be enough time to heavily irradiate fuel rods Also at the time Magnox reactors ran exclusively on very low enrichment or unenriched fuel limiting burnup and because burnup directly effects fuel element integrity early experiments with Magox reactors at higher burnup progressed conservatively with usage extended in small intervals Therefore the source of the plutonium can be determined to be either the very first round of spent fuel discharged from Berkeley after having been irradiated for only a period of about three months max or possibly was from an extended irradiation period at Chapplecross The fuel was not comparable to modern spent fuel because at the time no British reactor was capable of producing such material The fuel would have been lower than the US standard for weapons grade material but only slightly The nature of the test can be inferred by a combination of its timing and the vague statement released in 1997 This test was conducted to obtain nuclear design information concerning the feasibility of using reactor grade plutonium as the nuclear explosive material The test was probably done to establish a lower threshold for what would constitute acceptable plutonium for use in a weapon This had already been established by calculations and sub critical experiments but this test would confirm how lower quality plutonium worked in a weapon For example Would the fuel cycle of the new Berkley nuclear plant produce material with weapons potential Theory predicts that the use of plutonium of a quality slightly lower than the weapons grade standard would still produce a reasonable tactical yield in an advanced weapon design but would diminish the total yield significantly This is probably what happened in 1962 One must remember that the material was only slightly lower grade than weapons grade plutonium this is beyond question because of the source of the material being the low burnup Magox reactors Had it been from a modern power reactor or the power reactors that were being built outside the UK it simply would not have worked at all And finally on a fizzle bomb Some have said that this would be a deadly weapon as a super dirty bomb the reality is that it would be a very big bulky weapon that wouldn t be much more powerful than its own weight in dynamite It might spread around some plutonium but the radio toxicity of plutonium is not all that high and the spread of such material would be fairly local Given that it s primarily an alpha emitter it would have to be inhaled or ingested to cause harm If one went off a couple blocks would need to be shut down while some guys in Tyvex suits washed everything down We ve actually experienced some weapons accidents that spread plutonium in a local area before They weren t the end of the world As a strategic weapon it s useless as a tactical weapon it s pointless and as a weapon of terror it s only as terrifying as you let it be THEREFORE NO MATTER WHAT ANYONE SAYS SPENT FUEL FROM NUCLEAR POWER REACTORS AND ITS REPROCESSING IS ABSOLUTELY NOT A PROLIFERATION HAZARD IT DOES NOT BECOME ONE IF THEY SAY IT IS ENOUGH TIMES IT S NOT NOT PROCESSING NUCLEAR FUEL ON THE GROUNDS THAT IT PROMOTES NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROLIFERATION IS JUST PLAIN WRONG AND ALSO AN IDIOTIC ARGUMENT Understand This entry was posted on Saturday February 20th 2010 at 6 58 pm and is filed under Bad Science

what salted butter caramel tastes like The closest I could think of is an abrasive dulce de leche that has a harsh overtone but no that s not quite right In fact I m licking away spoonful after spoonful trying to figure out the right words to do this flavor justice Hm now let s see I think the easiest way is to describe the experience of eating it It s definitely creamy for one Not like an orange creamsicle creamy but like a caramel pumpkin latte creamy that you get during the brisk days of fall Digging the spoon into the carton is like digging your feet into sand The ice cream gives away easily leaving traces of a rugged trail It s as close to soft serve as you can get but with the consistency of a hardened ice cream And even when the ice cream melts it turns into a thick brown golden puddle When it refreezes it unexpectedly retains some of its soft creaminess It s also complex When it first sits on your tongue you can taste a strong toffee flavor Let it linger and that toffee turns sweet for the slightest second In the final moment the ice cream turns bitter but not bitter enough to remain for the aftertaste And the aftertaste Well it just tastes like pure caramel I love the way this custard base chills getting thicker by the hour until it becomes reminiscent of caramel pudding I love the way this ice cream churns so smoothly like silk rubbing against your skin I love the way this ice cream freezes a shade darker than the moment before I love everything about it from the moment I crack and separate the yolks from the egg whites to the moment the spoon lands into my mouth Everything about this ice cream is perfect Although Clare and Amy can t see eye to eye with me on salted butter caramel ice cream I know that Angela Jenny and Jungyon can I gave them a teaser taste the night before this flavor was set to debut and it made my day just to see their eyes widen while marveling at this unknown flavor And on the night when the ice cream did debut we killed off a good 90 of it going back for seconds then thirds and even fourths for some ahem Angela Though we couldn t finish the whole thing we started right where we left off less than 10 hours later for breakfast This was so irresistible that I made a second batch right after the three of them left Thank you David Lebovitz you ve made me a very happy girl Salted Butter Caramel Ice CreamTaken from David Lebovitz I suggest that you check out David s blogpost above as he offers his own description and process He also suggests adding a caramel praline mix which I omitted because I thought the ice cream was perfect as is Ingredients 2 cups 500 ml whole milk divided 1\u00bd cups 300 gr sugar 4 tablespoons 60 gr salted butter scant \u00bd teaspoon sea salt 1 cups 250 ml heavy cream 5 large egg yolks \u00be teaspoon vanilla extract Recipe In a large bowl make an ice bath by filling it a third full with ice and adding a cup of water or two The ice should be floating Insert a smaller metal bowl at least 2 quarts over the ice Pour 1 cup of the milk into the small bowl Lay a mesh strainer on top of it and set aside In a saucepan spread 1 5 cups of sugar in an even layer If your saucepan isn t big enough and the sugar lays on in a thick layer that s fine Cook over moderate heat making sure to stir when the sugar caramelizes This is the tough part because while you don t want the caramel to burn you want it to cook long enough so that the nutty notes peek through the sugary caramel The easiest way to tell when it s ready is when the caramel begins to smoke and bubble and is on the edge of burning Take it off the heat and stir in the butter and salt You ll get a seizing reaction where the butter bubbles wildly in the caramel Gradually whisk in the cream stirring as you go If the caramel gets too hard return it to the heat and continue to stir over low heat until any hard lumps are melted Stir in the other 1 cup of the milk Whisk the yolks in the small bowl and gradually temper the warm caramel mixture over the yolks Scrape the warmed yolks back into the saucepan and cook until it turns into a custard like consistency Scrap the bottom as you stir The ideal temperature is 160 170F and a good indication is when it coats the back of a wooden spoon evenly Pour the custard through the strainer into the milk that s in the ice bath Add the vanilla and then stir frequently until the mixture is cooled down Refrigerate for at least 8 hours or until thoroughly shilled The mixture will actually get thicker as it chills Freeze the mixture in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer s instructions Note While David suggests using la creme de la creme of salts fleur de sel I am too cheap to splurge 12 on a carton of salt so I stuck with seasalt If this is what salted butter caramel ice cream tasted like with sea salt then I can t even fathom what fleur de sel does to it In other words good sea salt should be sufficient You should also check

the main thing is to use it well Rene Descartes A person s IQ was thought to be a fixed commodity largely determined by genetics But is your IQ really set in stone or can you cheat a few extra points Recent hints suggest that a very basic brain function called working memory might underlie our general intelligence opening up the intriguing possibility that if you improve your working memory you could boost your IQ too Genetics determines a lot and so does the early gestation period On top of that there is a few percent that can be improved by training So if what you want is results and not an argument about the definition of intelligence try some of the following tips and boost your brain power 1 Game on Turn on your PC Modern games are great for making your mind work at amazing speeds It gives your brain a chance to think strategically and keeps it working 2 Spin it If you want to be a da Vinci or Edison keep a sketch diary Imagine seeing an object from every angle and sketch the views afterwards Thinking in pictures is essential for complex reasoning 3 Buy the paper While browsing through the sports pages take a peek at the crossword It s a perfect exercise for sharpening your mind Puzzles with creative solutions exercise and extend your dendrites the branch like parts of nerve cells that carry information and promote processing 4 Have a sniff Certain fragrances help you think clearly and cut down on mistakes Lemon scents stimulate your hippocampus the brain region that controls your ability to concentrate lavender helps you relax and think more clearly jasmine has the ability to excite resulting in quicker thinking 5 Turn on A recent study in the UK found that watching The Weakest Link for 30 minutes can raise your IQ by six points A documentary produced a four point rise Friends a rise of one point 6 Deep Breath This is one of the easiest and most effective tip to improve the functioning of your brain immediately More air in means more oxygen in the blood and therefore in the brain Low oxygen levels in the blood have been shown to decrease it Since most of us are in the habit of breathing too shallowly this is a quick way to boost your IQ One hint if you breath through your nose you are more likely to breath deeply 7 Daydream Letting your brain run free is the best way of truly expanding your brain power Every day consciously defocus for 10 minutes and see where it takes you 8 Detox To make sure you re thinking clearly avoid caffeine just one cup can cause a sharp rise in feelings of anxiety US scientists have found And like smoking caffeine also prevents the absorption of key vitamins essential for optimum brain function Replace coffee or tea with water and if you smoke don t 9 Multi task Performing two tasks simultaneously provides you with invaluable brain tools Put a TV next to a radio and try to take in information from both then try to concentrate on each individually You ll find you can focus on any single problem much better 10 Sit up straight and close your mouth Good posture affects our state of mind and helps us to think more clearly Wanna prove it to yourself Try solving some math in your head while slouching looking at the floor and letting your mouth hang open Then do the mental math while sitting up straight keeping your mouth closed and looking forward or slightly upwards You ll get the point 11 Stretch yourself Think of two unconnected objects a frog and a moped say and try to think of as many links between them as you can This breaks down the critical ability that interferes with the flow of ideas 12 And relax Simply relaxing increases your ability to learn In tests systematically flexing every muscle for 30 minutes boosted subjects ability to solve puzzles by up to 25 percent 13 Spell it out Facing a problem Write it down and draw lines radiating out to words and ideas linked to each one Your mind will be able to visualize an answer far more easily 14 Make connections To grow longer dendrites do something new Try learning a new language or developing a skill such as drawing and you ll see instant changes in how you think 15 Step it up Aerobic fitness helps fluid intelligence learning new things frontal lobes planning ahead and your ability to make rapid fire decisions Go for at least three 30 minute cardio sessions a week 16 Get dreaming You knew this one right Uninterrupted sleep is key to information processing Avoid caffeine six hours before bed and relax with a hot bath and a milky drink packed with sleep inducing tryptophans 17 Take a stroll A recent study found that just 45 minutes of walking three times a week increased subjects ability to perform multiple tasks by up to 15 percent improving bloodflow to the frontal lobes of the brain 18 Watch the clock Use your brain when it s at its sharpest early in the morning Research shows that taking tests before midday boosts success rates by up to five percent 19 Consume ginkgo biloba Whether in capsules or tea or off a neighbors tree ginkgo leaves have been shown to increase blood flow to the brain helping memory and concentration The effect is quick and doesn t seem to diminish with regular use 20 Graze To give your brain a steady supply of energy and minerals eat little and often Eating large meals shunts blood to your digestive tract away from your brain 21 Go classical In a US study listening to a Mozart piano sonata improved students 3 D problem solving abilities as opposed to verbal or language skills by 15 percent Aim for 10 minutes of Classic FM a day 22 Practice IQ tests are just one form of measuring intelligence so if you re really trying to impress the answer is simply to practice again and again and again 23 Eat your meat A meal that s overloaded with carbohydrates can spell trouble for the brain In a Harvard study people who ate pure carbohydrates had up to twice the difficulty concentrating and performing mental tasks as those who d eaten turkey which is practically carb free This is due to the insulin that is dumped into your veins after the sugar is Don t eat white flour sugar potatoes and other carbs before an important meeting 24 Freshen up Chewing gum improves memory and thinking UK researchers have found Chewing raises your heart rate delivering more oxygen and glucose to the brain while saliva triggers a surge of insulin stimulating learning and memory receptors in the brain 25 Make friends Preferably ones with large amounts of frizzy grey hair Recent research showed that hanging out with boffins can boost your IQ by up to 10 percent 26 Go herbal Plants naturally encourage your brain and body to work together Rosemary increases bloodflow to the brain and sage improves concentration 27 Head for the bees To boost your brain power look for vitamin B found in oats tuna chicken wholewheat and bananas Vitamin B6 aids memory while 1 2 3 and 12 help manufacture and repair brain tissue Let the experts argue about whether you can boost IQ or not in any absolute sense If you slept well exercised then sat up straight and breathed deeply as you took the test don t you think you would score a few points higher on an intelligence quotient test More importantly wouldn t you be better prepared for whatever mental tasks you faced If you liked this article please bookmark it on del icio us or vote for it on Digg

December 2010 by GraceI finally started my Christmas Cookie baking with the ever so popular Spritz Cookie But I didn t want to just share with you any Spritz Cookie these are Chocolate Hazelnut Spritz Cookies One of the biggest dilemmas I face around the Holidays is choosing which Christmas Cookies to bake The varieties are endless And to make the choice even more difficult every food magazine declares they have the Best Holiday Recipes with a photo spread that will have you yearning to make each and every one The Spritz Cookie is basically a Swedish Butter Cookie Usually this rich buttery cookie is put through a cookie press but not this one I saw these piped Cocoa Hazelnut Spritz Cookies featured on Delicious Days I was instantly inspired to do the same I set out with my normal enthusiasm but it didn t take me long to realize there was a reason the dough was usually put through a press piping these cookies was very hard work tough dough I kept reminding myself that not only was I producing some delicious cookies I was also working on my biceps Of course the spread in Delicious Days was very impressive How Nicky was able to make hers look so perfect I don t know We were snowed in yet again yesterday and I thought it would be the perfect day to start my Christmas baking I was wrong The phone was ringing off the hook the doorbell was chiming endlessly and the kids were full of questions It was all good but I was in cookie baking mode I realized I baked the first batch a little too long because they started to crack a little on top I was confident the next batch would be better but then the phone rang and I missed the ding of the oven timer Did I get one batch perfectly baked Absolutely not But sometimes that s life I d rather have a crazy kitchen loving family caring friends and over baked cookies any day Regardless of the complications in the preparation and baking process this Spritz Cookie recipe is pretty forgiving The results were definitely worth the effort Plus how can you go wrong with the classic pairing of chocolate and hazelnut Especially when it s combined with a mouthwatering buttery tender texture and then dipped in luscious chocolate and sprinkled with yet another layer of nutty deliciousness That s better than visions of sugarplums any day I really enjoy the pairing of chocolate and nuts not only the flavour combination but also the texture I baked these Dark Chocolate Almond Crackles the other day And we couldn t possibly go through the Holidays without a batch of Chocolate Thumbprints with Chocolate Vanilla Bean Ganache filling family favourite I also plan to make a batch of Lime Meltaways for the citrus lovers me in my family And I am so anxious to try Marly s NamelyMarly Chocolate Topped Shortbread Cookies

"http://www.well.com/user/vard/cookies.html"	"2462"	"{""title"":""Secrets of really good chocolate chip cookies "",""body"":""Secrets of really good chocolate chip cookies updated February 28 2010 The recipe on the back of the Nestle Toll House Morsels tm bag makes fine cookies and if you were to follow it precisely you couldn t go too far wrong However based upon my own experience and that of others I advise a few minor modifications and refinements First always use real butter Don t let anyone convince you that butter vs margarine doesn t make any difference It does Another reason to use real butter instead of margarine or Crisco HYDROGENATED FATS As in margarine and Crisco are teeming with them while butter is a natural product and contains no hydrogenated fats Second TRIPLE the amount of vanilla extract recommended This means to use a tablespoon where a teaspoon is specified Also always use real vanilla extract and not vanillin which is bogus although cheaper and sold next to the genuine article in many grocery stores Feh Incidentally vanilla is a wondrous and versatile substance Click here to find out everything you ever wanted to know about vanilla and some things you never suspected Third and this can make a big difference don t just let the butter sit out at room temperature to become soft Instead melt it very carefully so that it doesn t burn you can use a double boiler if anyone out there still has one or else a microwave oven that is set very low and which you are watching like a hawk A microwave can burn the butter in a second if you turn your back at an inopportune moment Use a Pyrex or other microwave safe transparent container if you do this so you can watch the butter closely Melted butter because it is both warm and liquid does a much better job of dissolving and melting the sugar than a room temperature creamed butter can do improving the consistency of the dough as you are working with it and also improving the texture of the cookies after they are baked My friend Lizabeth says that she gets much better results using melted butter and superfine granulated sugar and I believe her however I have never had a problem with the texture of cookies made with ordinary granulated sugar Also if you re like me you have often had a problem with your brown sugar clumping together into giant bricks which you are then banging on the edge of the kitchen counter in order to break them up enough to use the stuff still big lumps of brown sugar survive even into the baked cookies Well if you take the big solid mass of brown sugar roughly the volume you desire put it into the microwave with the melting butter in the Pyrex cup and let it melt on a very low setting for a few minutes you will find that the brown sugar will liquefy very nicely It will help it along if you stir the contents for a few seconds after removing the cup from the microwave It will then pour smoothly into the mixing bowl Let it cool briefly before adding the eggs so they don t poach before you can mix them into the other wet ingredients Many correspondents have written to tell me that a slice of white bread placed into the sealed plastic bag with the bricklike mass of brown sugar will soften it within a day My mother likes to use a slice of apple In either case put it into the plastic bag with the brown sugar and seal it up and check it again in 24 hours Fourth add a little milk maybe just a tablespoon or two when you are mixing the dough This will make it less stiff and the cookies will be less hard and crunchy when they are done If you do this though make sure the dough is nice and cold as you drop it onto the cookie sheet and also make sure the cookie sheet is room temperature or cooler when you put the dough on it and put it into the oven If the dough melts around the edges before it starts to bake sometimes the edges will burn or get too brown Frankly the cookies always taste better if you let the dough chill overnight before baking anyway It s just that most of us don t have the patience Fifth if you like try leaving out part of the sugar I find sometimes that these cookies are easier to take if even 1 8 cup two tablespoons of the sugar white or brown is omitted Don t leave out more than that though If you like try adding a 10 ounce bag of Reese s peanut butter chips along with the chocolate chips This makes a great cookie but if you do this it is probably best to omit the nuts Or try adding a bag of butterscotch chips and substituting oatmeal for the nuts A lot of people have written to tell me that they love to add a package of instant vanilla pudding mix This does sound good and it makes sense for a lot of reasons I will try it sometime soon You can also experiment with untraditional mixes of white and brown sugar until you achieve the version you like best In addition although I have not yet tried this myself I am told that it is possible to substitute honey on a one to one basis for the brown sugar resulting in nice chewy cookies with a longer shelf life I recently received mail from someone who likes to use almond extract in equal parts with vanilla and who also tells me that the honey trick didn t work for her But she does recommend substituting bran for a small part of the flour I would make it not more than a tablespoon or two to make the cookies chewier She sometimes adds cinnamon to taste I d say not more than a teaspoon total and perhaps less and observes that stirring chopped up Heath bars into the dough can create a great cookie She didn t say this specifically but I d advise against using the cinnamon and Heath bars in the same batch Note that Toll House dough without chips but with a fair amount of cinnamon might be a nice variation on the traditional American cookie called the snickerdoodle So many people write to me to ask about problems they run into making Toll House cookies and the 1 problem I hear about is My cookies come out flat What can I do This is such a common problem Here are the first few things you should check make sure your cookie dough is cold when you put it on the cookie sheet If you have to chill it in between batches that s what you should do make sure your cookie sheet is cooled to room temperature between batches I usually rinse mine under the tap to clean off the crumbs and cool it down mix the dough thoroughly but don t over mix it try adding a tablespoon up to an additional 1 4 cup of flour to the recipe don t overbake Some people experiment with adding baking powder instead of or in addition to the baking soda which is part of the recipe I haven t tried this yet Other people swear that if you use butter flavored Crisco instead of real butter this problem goes away Again I am a butter loyalist and so I haven t tried that although in the interests of science someday I should However because of all those hydrogenated fats I mentioned above you or I might not want to use Crisco or any other form of shortening in our cookies How then to achieve the desired appearance texture and consistency Here s one trick instead of using all butter in your cookies you can use half butter and half liquid vegetable oil like corn canola or safflower oil or even peanut oil This results in a nice chewy cookie with a pleasing appearance and flavor and a longer shelf life than one baked with butter alone A correspondent in Canada urges that real maple syrup emphasis on the real no Mrs Butterworth s please also makes a fine substitute for the brown sugar I think I d also advise against using Heath bars and maple syrup together maple syrup and cinnamon might be OK Another correspondent says that adding a dollop of sour cream improves the texture of the cookies making them chewier and increasing their shelf life She swears that the sour cream can t be tasted and I m sure that s true sour cream assimilates well into other foods and these cookies have enough other strong flavors in them that some sour cream shouldn t be noticeable The 64K question of course is how much is a dollop I d say take a soupspoon and spoon out a heaping scoop of sour cream maybe an inch or so above the top of the bowl of the spoon at its highest point that s a dollop YDMV Your Dollop May Vary Experiment and see what you like Whether or not you use Heath bars cinnamon maple syrup or other non standard ingredients the nuts are optional Many people prefer chocolate chip cookies without nuts Alternatively you can try adding oatmeal even if you don t add butterscotch chips in the same volume as the nuts called for by the recipe but if you do this be sure to add more liquid My friend Susan says that she doesn t bother adding more liquid and her cookies turn out fine but I prefer always to add that extra tablespoon or two of milk Also if you add the Reese s peanut butter morsels as discussed above they melt and create some additional moistness in the cookies The morsels don t have to be Nestle However in my experience Nestle morsels do melt in a most satisfactory way during the baking process Ghirardelli and Guittard morsels are very good I also like the Hershey mini morsels for this The standard size Hershey Morsels however do not melt properly at least not in the eight to ten minute baking time of cookies and I do not recommend them for use in cookies although they are terrific in brownies which bake for a much longer period The morsels MUST however be semisweet i e dark chocolate Milk chocolate morsels which are sold in similar bags to the undiscerning are massively too sweet to put into these cookies I do feel obligated to point out for that matter that both the morsels and the baking itself can be optional Those of us who make chocolate chip cookies know how important it is to sample the dough before baking And I d have to confess that sometimes the raw dough I prefer my raw dough chipless is even better than the cookies If you do like to eat raw dough though be careful Any foodstuff containing raw eggs can harbor salmonella and or other nasty little bacteria Don t use eggs that were cracked before you opened them Wash the eggshells in warm soapy water and rinse them well before cracking the eggs and using them Alternatively use one of the pasteurized egg substitutes And remember that raw dough can be risky It is especially risky for anyone with a susceptibility to infections or a compromised immune system So be cautious But also have fun This page was last updated February 28 2010 Since December 18 1995 at least folks have come by to pick up some tips on chocolate chip cookies Glad you could join us Please email me with any suggestions or comments and stop by again soon Also you can read some of the great mail I ve already received These

there was a cyber world to abuse with criminals stealing information money and identities shutting down businesses and compromising security all over the world As more and more of us have taken to using our mobile phones for browsing the web banking and shopping smartphone only mobile commerce was up 221 this Thanksgiving the risk of cybercrime grows ever larger on mobile devices which criminals are increasingly eyeing as a promising new source of revenue Thankfully mobile cybercrimes are still relatively rare but in recent years major security scares viruses and other mobile crimes have become bigger issues and it s only a matter of time before mobile devices are seeing a scourge of cybercriminal attacks In fact 92 of information security officers believe that mobile payments will cause a serious increase in cybercrime over the next few years Here are some m commerce crime trends to watch out for now and in the coming years as criminals look to take advantage of the security flaws and popularity of mobile browsing and shopping Rootkit installation A rootkit is a particularly stealthy type of software that installs itself on a user s device and hides itself from the normal modes of detection letting it operate in secret to get privileged access to a computer and its user s information In the past these malicious programs were limited to laptops and desktop computers but they re becoming a threat from mobile phones as well as revealed by research at Rutgers in 2010 A rootkit when installed on a phone could affect every part of the phone from the touch screen to the passwords These programs can not only steal information they could potentially even reroute calls from legitimate businesses to criminal operations That s not a threat to take lightly and many are advising mobile users to be careful what they view and with certain operating systems use anti virus and anti malware software Risky QR codes QR codes can be a cool way for consumers to find out more about products and find a wealth of information with very little effort but they re not always safe Mobile phone users never quite know where the codes will take them once scanned and in a growing number of cases QR codes are leading to sites that download a virus or malware onto the user s mobile device Mobile security experts are already seeing a rash of QR code problems and expect them to grow significantly in number over the next year Theft of digital certificates If thieves can bypass a mobile phone s security they can steal digital certificates What are digital certificates They re what verify that a user sending information is who she or he claims to be As you might guess someone else having access to the ability to pretend to be you could be a pretty serious security risk While that risk already exists when you use a PC it s increasingly becoming a concern for mobile users as well and was identified by AVG Technologies as being one of the most pressing issues in mobile security Smishing Like its cousin phishing smishing tries to trick individuals into revealing personal private information Smishers send their victims an SMS text message baiting them into divulging personal details like bank account credit card or social security numbers Smishers often pose as businesses drawing in those who believe they re simply helping keep their accounts in good standing avoiding bogus charges the smishers say they ll owe if they don t comply or sometimes even trying to win a fake prize Sometimes smishers aim to collect personal information directly and other times they are trying to install malware that can allow a phone to be controlled remotely Recent reports place smishing as one of the most common reasons for criminal data loss Social engineering Sadly there s such a big business built up around this kind of mobile crime that there are even common job titles associated with it confirmer is one big one Social engineers scam mobile users by either tricking them into giving them private information or by tricking companies that the individual uses Sometimes criminals will hack into bank accounts and change customer contact information When frauds occur the bank will contact not the customer but the criminal who will verify the charges these are those pesky confirmers Social engineering occurs in such a wide variety of ways that it s hard to fight Consumers will just need to be on their toes and watch out for any unusual activity to avoid becoming victims Unsecured Wi Fi threats Think you re safe from cybercriminals when you re sitting at home using your Wi Fi to browse the web You may not be Wi Fi offers many criminals easy access to your information if you re not careful While a secured home Wi Fi network offers some protection many mobile consumers use public networks for Wi Fi too which can open them up to criminals who steal their personal information or hijack their interactions with banks and businesses Some tests have found that most Wi Fi networks can be hacked in five minutes or less so mobile users should do any private business on their cells while on their mobile plan not Wi Fi Viruses and malware According to McAfee a leading antivirus provider mobile security threats rose by 46 in 2010 Yet a whopping 70 of mobile phone users felt that their smartphones were safe from these kinds of attacks That false sense of security may be leading many mobile users to become unwitting victims of cybercrimes While viruses and malware that attack mobile phones are still rare in comparison to those designed to attack PCs the growing number of smartphones and tablets has become a new ever bigger target for criminals Experts advise not only mobile customers but also businesses to prepare for a growth in this kind of attack by creating more secure apps or payment systems and offering better support to consumers Crimeware App stores open up a wealth of opportunities for criminals to fill your mobile device with crimeware No one would willingly download a program onto their smartphone that would cause them to be the victim of fraud but crimeware is disguised as being a different type of program altogether perhaps a game or a useful utility In fact the app may actually run in that fashion The problem is however that it comes with a tagalong malware or other tracking device that lets criminals access information control the phone and a range of other malicious activites Think it can t happen to you The BBC reports that the proliferation of these apps has increased from just 29 to 62 of all smartphone malware this year Encryption hacking You and the businesses you frequent might think encrypting data keeps you all safe For sophisticated cybercriminals however encryption may not be a roadblock to stealing your personal information your money or your identity It s becoming increasingly easy for criminals to crack the most common types of encryption and with many governments blocking the use of high level encryption technology so that they can break the codes if necessary for law enforcement purposes consumers and businesses alike are stuck in a particular sticky situation Your best bet Be as careful as you can watch for any indications of fraud and use the highest level encryption possible for all sensitive data Electronic eavesdropping Whether you re calling a business to order goods or taking a photo of your home someone can be listening in Unfortunately electronic eavesdropping is possible via a number of different methods It can occur over unsecured Wi Fi networks or through malicious apps but no matter how it happens it s a very serious security threat that could result in large amounts of critical personal information being compromised With a recent report by the Government Accountability Office finding a rise in malicious software aimed at mobile devices of about 185 in just a year there s reason to worry for both businesses who want to keep transactions secure and customers who want to keep information out of the wrong hands This entry was posted on Thursday December 6th 2012 at 11 19 pm and is filed under Uncategorized You can

has spent 5 minutes watching the NFL NBA draft realizes how homoerotic commentators can be when they describe the athletic acuity of college prospects To make it decidedly less gay the Banned in Hollywood editors have constructed the first ever Female Fantasy Draft Draft order was predetermined by number of women notched on our belts Since Peter is still a virgin he gets first pick Round 1 Returner Woman you can bring home to the parents 1 Natalie Portman Jerusalem Irsael Peter Reason for drafting Shes hot a Harvard grad and because she s Jewish she ll like my mom because she can t stand her own SeanThomas I thought you were part German That s going to go over REAL well Peter No moron you re part German I m Irish SeanThomas Oh yeah Well you ll be drunk either way Brotha Jonze I m part German so you can have her I look for a woman who can cook and as a returner Natalie Portman and my industrial sized oven wouldn t get along I should just invest in a nice Dutch oven to avoid any complications in my future 2 Scarlett Johansson New York New York SeanThomas Reason for drafting She s got bust written all over her and I don t really mind Physically gifted fluid hips and she s charming She wins my dad s heart without saying a word Did I mention she dresses classy Brotha Jonze Don t get me wrong she looks good now but give her ten years and those chest hams will sag and she ll put on a few pounds which is unacceptable as a returner you re looking for quickness in the sack and consistency Imagine her with a belly the face just doesn t hold up SeanThomas She s reached her ceiling I ll give you that Hopefully her legs can reach mine Brotha Jonze Touche good sir Touche 3 Gemma Atkinson Bury Greater Manchester England Brotha Jonze Reason for drafting Her accent SeanThomas Your parents must subscribe to the she has an English accent and therefore smart theory which most Americans seem to have Her intelligence is about as real as her chest Brotha Jonze Which is perfect because I get all the benefits of others thinking she s smart without actually being so Why would you want a smart girl Sean If you dated a smart chick she d leave you before you got her in bed SeanThomas Gemma seems to dig the soccer players On the bright side you might be the first straight guy she s screwed Peter Enjoy your raging case of the Cristiano Ronaldo strain Brotha Jonze Hey at least AIDS kills you Better than living the rest of your life with a bumpy dick right Round 2 Shortstop Woman under 5 2 1 Jaime Hammer Chicago Illinois Brotha Jonze Reason for drafting At 5 2 and 34DD I don t know how she manages to stay upright It s great because she ll be anxious to get on her back Plus I already know what she looks like naked which is nice See JaimeHammer com SeanThomas Sorry you won t be able to have sex with Jaime for you are not a a porn star or b her uncle Enjoy your therapy sessions Brotha Jonze Hey as long as it s massage therapy I m cool Peter Picking a porn star is a risky move they re known to have character issues but they are team players Brotha Jonze And disease free SeanThomas I hear she handles the tip drill well Brotha Jonze As well as my massive drill tip 2 Hayden Panettiere Palisades New York SeanThomas Reason for drafting At 5 2 and only 18 years young she s got a great upside and even better backside She saves dolphins not the NFL variety that s impossible for chrissakes God made this perfect creature for me and I shall take her god I shall take her Peter Sean continues his draft philosophy of taking girls right out of high school and the occasional sixteen year old Dominican Brotha Jonze Erroneous the Dominican was actually a 23 year old Dodger prospect A big mistake that if you don t remember disqualified him from the 2003 draft As far as high school goes though he s trying to get what he couldn t when he went to high school SeanThomas I subscribe to the Chris Hanson school of drafting scout them when they re young pick them when they re ripe Brotha Jonze and if one of then turns out to be a 23 year old Dominican male roll with it SeanThomas Don t hate the player hate the penis Between Picks Peter Goddamn it she s 5 3 Brotha Jonze Who Peter Emmanuelle Chriqui SeanThomas Just take the wife from Little People Big World and get it over with Brotha Jonze Haha SeanThomas On a side note Jaime Hammer majored in communications at Arizona State I don t know which is a worse bottom majoring in communications at ASU or being a porn star My money s on the former Brotha Jonze Well yea softcore ain t that bad ASU whole different story SeanThomas I went on to graduate in the spring of 2004 Cum Laude with a BA in communications It s only a matter of time before she starts hardcore 3 Reese Witherspoon New Orleans Louisiana Peter Reason for drafting I have a candy fetish and want to call a girl s Reese s Pieces in bed SeanThomas If you re going the candy route at least go for Heather Graham she was Roller girl for chrissakes Instead you pick an over 30 divorcee with a kid Brotha Jonze Plus she sounds like a mixture between Miss Piggy and Felix the Cat Though to a man with a fetish sounding like a barnyard animal probably isn t such a bad thing SeanThomas That s not even counting her singing voice Johnny Cash would beat her with the butt end of his guitar if he was still alive for that atrocious performance SeanThomas I see her listed at 5 3 again you re trying to squeeze an inch on someone Too bad we re not your gullible ex girlfriend SeanThomas Peter if you have any retorts please feel free If not i haven t seen a raping that bad since Kobe was released inside the Bunny Ranch Peter I didn t even realize that was an insult I m kind of a skimmer When I saw squeezing an inch and ex girlfriend I assume Sean was bitching about his sex life again Impressive muscle control on that girl though Brotha Jonze Ex girlfriend should have tipped that Sean wasn t in the equation Round 3 Long Reliever Tall Woman Between Picks Peter What qualifies for tall girl SeanThomas 5 11 and above Peter 5 11 You f cker Make it 5 10 SeanThomas You re not allowed to pick siblings anyway 1 Mandy Moore Nashua New Hampshire Peter Reason for drafting She s 5 11 Brotha Jonze Damn Never knew she was that tall SeanThomas There should be an automatic DQ for being associated with A Walk to Remember Peter Yeah I ll give her A Cock to Remember Brotha Jonze Not that 1 BS again SeanThomas Yeah I doubt she s seen one that small That s bound to emotionally scar anyone Peter Plus I can marry her have her die off in a year and I get all her sh t SeanThomas Your wardrobe lacking sequins gowns these days That s about all she s got to offer besides her bad choice in men Brotha Jonze Which would surprisingly give Peter a shot 2 Maria Sharapova Siberia Russia SeanThomas Reason for drafting At an amazing 6 1 Ronald Reagan wouldn t hate the reds so much if he knew they d produce this babe Quite the forehand I hear That and it s easy living off her 23 million salary Hey someone has to support the couch and TV Peter And as an upside you can get a lucrative contract with Canon to be the next insignificant and annoying pet that she lets watch when she has sex SeanThomas As long as i have some place to sit and a box of tissues handy Brotha Jonze Tissues to clean up some other guys mess SeanThomas I heard she s a squirter just doing my part Brotha Jonze Ok I get it like the ball boys that run across the grass at Wimbledon 3 Janet Reno Miami Florida Brotha Jonze Reason for drafting Coming in at an astounding 6 3 and weighing upwards of 230 lbs I choose Janet Reno as the closing pick of the 3rd round Frankly I m surprised this workhorse didn t go earlier SeanThomas Veteran pick I like the experience Peter You can only pick Reno for tall if you pick Albright for shortstop You can call your bitches The Cabinet Brotha Jonze Which unfortunately is where I will have to keep them if I keep choosing cattle like Reno SeanThomas On the downside if you pick Eva Mendes in a future round she ll send her ass packing back to Cuba Peter I feel like Reno can carry the load for your team Brotha Jonze Which is great because i don t want her near my load Strategy over sexuality boys Round 4 Tightend Best ass 1 Brittany Daniel Gainesville Florida Brotha Jonze Reason for drafting I officially select Brittany Daniel with long hair because she has a smokin body and was in one episode of Still the Beaver Peter She also played a tranny on Always Sunny which I m guessing is when you took an interest in her SeanThomas Pre op is just investing early It s like getting shares of Google in 04 Brotha Jonze Right or entering your senior year of college while dating a high school chick Got to get um fresh SeanThomas I m curious after the operation do you use the penis as wall decoration or do you throw it into your jambalaya Brotha Jonze Sautee it with the sausage and shellfish you ll never know the difference 2 Keyra Agustina Buenos Aires Argentina SeanThomas Reason for drafting With the second selection of the 4th round I m going out of the country to Argentina She s a sleeper pick and can use her caboose as a pillow If you don t know her ass Google it It appears more times than her face Brotha Jonze That ass hasn t seen pants in so long it s oxidizing SeanThomas There aren t enough Chinese laborers in the world to sew her a pair of pants to fit that thing Brotha Jonze Tell that to Oprah SeanThomas Yeah but she outsources to Africa What you thought that school was free 3 Jessica Biel Ely Minnesota Peter Reason for drafting A girl who agreed to be in Stealth will agree to do anything SeanThomas I m not surprised Peter took Biel He loves Justin Timberlake s sloppy seconds You thought those were Federline s kids The cleft palate and bangs were a dead giveaway it was Peter Brotha Jonze That s a great point Sean and based on Timberlake s Track record see Britney Spears Biel s degeneration has already begun SeanThomas The Peter Principle in action Round 5 Special Teams Girl with a handicap 1 Marlee Matlin Morton Grove Illinois Peter Reason for drafting The thought of that voice talking dirty makes me giggle SeanThomas It s a good thing she s deaf because she won t be able to hear you cry after sex Brotha Jonze It is nice to see a celebrity with some humility Her next film Silent Knights hits box offices later this year 2 Jennifer Krum Harrisburg Pennsylvania SeanThomas Reason for drafting The first of Howard Stern s Miss Amputee She s got a wicked stiff arm Plus she was in Playboy that fulfills two fantasies Peter Finally Sean has found a girl who can get her elbow past his sphincter SeanThomas We can t all be as loose as you Between picks SeanThomas Ten bucks he s going to take Corky from Life Goes On 3 Agusta Urica Luanda Angola Brotha Jonze Reason for drafting I see you re Miss Amputee and raise you Miss Landmine 2008 SeanThomas I thought about Agusta but i want a woman with more agility Brotha Jonze Something necessary for special teams http www foxnews com story 0 2933 345628 00 html Peter Of course its on Fox News SeanThomas I guess she doesn t fit the profile for being fair or balanced Timber Brotha Jonze That s true but Urica who is unemployed and represents the capital Luanda also won 1 000 a motorbike clothes a weekend in a luxury hotel and a variety of domestic appliances Peter A motorbike Do they want her to be the kickstand SeanThomas I love how she gets domestic appliances though That s like saying you re pretty much useless as a human being we hope you like to cook and clean Round 6 Designated Hitter Woman who does drugs 1 Mo Nique Woodlawn Maryland Peter Reason for drafting I m about to head out so I m going to trade up to this draft slot and take Mo Nique as my designated hitter for the sole reason that she looks like David Ortiz SeanThomas Designated hitter is someone who does drugs which explains your last pick I guess Peter Horse tranquilizers count SeanThomas Going on a date with Sarah Jessica Parker tonight 2 Charlize Theron Benoni South Africa Brotha Jonze Reason for drafting One thing a good DH is is resourceful and flexible You re not playing everyday and so as my final pick I am going with Charlize Theron because hitting an apple is clutch what else do you need from your DH SeanThomas Well at least Charlize smokes from apples Gweneth Paltrow names her kids after them 3 Tara Conner Dallas Texas SeanThomas Reason for drafting The former Miss USA winner is a bisexual coke addict Brotha Jonze Is she a pageant winner or student at USC I don t expect her to go outside the foul lines often she ll probably just snort them Draft Summary Peter Natalie Portman Returner Reese Witherspoon Shortstop Mandy Moore Long Reliever Jessica Biel Tight End Marlee Matlin Special Teams Mo Nique Designated Hitter SeanThomas Scarlett Johansson Returner Hayden Panettiere Shortstop Maria Sharapova Long Reliever Keyra Agustina Tight End Jennifer Krum Special Teams Tara Conner Designated Hitter Brotha Jonze Gemma Atkinson Returner Jaime Hammer Shortstop Janet Reno Long

the cake that will spark a stampede to your door"",""body"":""Warning I think I hit more tangents than usual in this post Recipe is at the bottom if you wanna skip through the interesting tidbits about my family negative people my dish envy and complaints about my kitchen Looking over some of my past posts I noticed I have a habit of going on and on about how I love everything I post Thing is though I DO love everything I post If I didn t love it I wouldn t share the recipes with you because I want you to love everything I post too Alright now that I ve gotten that off my chest let me start posting about this cake by saying I LOVE THIS CAKE Furthermore EVERYONE LOVES THIS CAKE Grown men swoon for it Children polish their halos and change their vocabulary to mother dear for it No cake I have ever had in a restaurant holds a candle to THIS one THIS is the ultimate in decadence and guess what else EASE This is the easiest cake on earth to make Never have you stopped a show with so little effort This recipe came from my sister in law Stacey Stacey married into our family about ten years ago We kind of feel sorry for her from time to time being married into our brood and all but since she had been a guest at my sleepovers as far back as third grade she clearly came in with her eyes wide open She has learned to adapt quite well to the vast quantities of food we turn out everytime someone blinks funny and she has resigned herself to the possibility that being married to a Davis is not conducive to making it back to that size zero bikini She has also done the one thing that we all must do eventually learn to cook just like Mama Stacey is a GREAT cook Thing is she didn t cook at all for the first half of their marriage she was a working mom Once she quit her job to raise the spawn of Bill my two sweet nephews but spawn of Bill sounds better she took up cooking and made up for lost time Now Stacey makes the best fried apple pies in the state and she frequently spends a day making twenty or so full sized cakes for my brother s catering jobs Still as good a cook as Stacey is her shining contribution to our family s good eatin will always be The Butterfinger Cake Did you hear an angelic choir when I said that Butterfinger Cake There it was again You will need Devil s Food Cake Mix The cheaper the better we want a good old coarse cake Can Sweetened Condensed Milk Caramel Topping Cool Whip Butterfinger Bar My brother Bill took these pics and Stacey made the cake She has such a large open bright and sunny kitchen Not that I m jealous or anything I love my 6 8 dungeonesque walk in closet with appliances Really I do Sighs Prepare cake according to package directions When it comes out poke holes all in it with a fork just like we did on the Elvis Presley cake Don t stop til it looks like a swarm of four toothed mosquitoes attacked Dang I didn t know Stacey had the Fire King 9 13 dish Those were issued in 2000 and didn t stay on the market long I got a bowl but never the dish I really want the dish now Pour entire can of sweetened condensed milk and jar of caramel topping into bowl or glass and stir to combine You know what negative people need A BIG OLD BITE of this cake shoved right in their mouth to sweeten them up When they come up for air shove another bite in Hey come to think of it if y all have any negative or grouchy people in your life you really should make them this cake today Honestly surprising them with this cake might just turn them around It would at the very least cause them to take pause and look at you in a renewed light Killing folks with kindness really does work I swear it I ve tried it and been successful every single time Where was I Oh yes While the cake is still hot pour the caramel condensed milk all over the top and spread it around evenly Then let it soak in Oh my good lord almighty this is gonna be good Crush your butterfinger bar I had to look at this a minute before I was able to figure out what it was At first I thought Stacey had sent me a photograph of a bowl of cereal for some reason Sprinkle 3 4 of butterfinger crumbs over cake Now let it cool a bit I stick mine in the fridge at this point Waiting is really hard because I have got you wanting to eat it real bad at this point don t I Oh just wait it gets so much better and you have to wait even longer Oooh now look whose being negative Alright let me rephrase in a bright and chipper Mary Poppin s voice Oh just you wait although it may still be a while until the cake is ready the wait will be rewarded with such a delicious delight and you will have earned it through all of your selfless hard work You re such a good person for making this That was better Once it is cooled top with the whole thing of whipped cream and remaining butterfinger crumbs Refrigerate Now you can eat this now but it really and truly should get good and cold before you do Alright so go ahead and eat a bit now if you have to but just promise me you ll have another slice once it cools You may even need to have two or three slices once it is good and cold so you can make sure you are tasting it fully as it would be quite rude to serve something to others which you have not adequately tasted for their own good of course Ingredients1 box devil s food cake mix 1 bottle caramel topping 1 can Condensed milk 1 large tub cool whip 1 Butterfinger barInstructionsPrepare cake according to package directions Immediately after removing cake from oven poke several holes all over the top with a fork Mix sweetened condensed milk and

an office chair or on your couch for more than six hours a day Then here are some disturbing facts Your risk of heart disease has increased by up to 64 percent You re shaving off seven years of quality life You re also more at risk for certain types of cancer Simply put sitting is killing you That s the bad news The good news It s easy to counteract no matter how lazy you are Photo remixed from Lack O Keen Shutterstock and Nip Shutterstock Let s start with the basics Since childhood you ve known being a couch potato is bad But why Simply put our bodies weren t made to sit all day Sitting for long periods of time even with exercise has a negative effect on our health What s worse many of us sit up to 15 hours a day That means some of us spend the bulk of our waking moments on the couch in an office chair or in a car Sitting all day long isn t hard to counteract but you have to keep your eye on two details your daily activity and the amount of time you sit Let s start by taking a look at what sitting all day does to your body An Estimated Timeline of the Effects of Sitting It s difficult to get an accurate assessment of what sitting all day will do to you because the effects work in tandem with diet and other risk factors So we re going to start with a relatively healthy person who does not drink in excess smoke and who isn t overweight Then we ll estimate the effects of sitting for over six hours a day based on what starts happening immediately after you sit down For a general overview of the effects take a look at this chart from Medical Billing and Coding to see a breakdown of what that happens in your body when you sit down If the majority of your sitting time takes place at a desk keep in mind that a standing desk has its own problems too Immediately After Sitting Right after you sit down the electrical activity in your muscles slows down and your calorie burning rate drops to one calorie per minute This is about a third of what it does if you re walking If you sit for a full 24 hour period you experience a 40 percent reduction in glucose uptake in insulin which can eventually cause type 2 diabetes After Two Weeks of Sitting for More Than Six Hours a Day Within five days of changing to a sedentary lifestyle your body increases plasma triglycerides fatty molecules LDL cholesterol aka bad cholesterol and insulin resistance This means your muscles aren t taking in fat and your blood sugar levels go up putting you at risk for weight gain After just two weeks your muscles start to atrophy and your maximum oxygen consumption drops This makes stairs harder to climb and walks harder to take Even if you were working out every day the deterioration starts the second you stop moving After One Year of Sitting More Than Six Hours a Day After a year the longer term effects of sitting can start to manifest subtly According to this study by Nature you might start to experience weight gain and high cholesterol Studies in woman suggest you can lose up to 1 percent of bone mass a year by sitting for over six hours a day After 10 20 Years of Sitting More Than Six Hours a Day Sitting for over six hours a day for a decade or two can cut away about seven quality adjusted life years the kind you want It increases your risk of dying of heart disease by 64 percent and your overall risk of prostate or breast cancer increases 30 percent If this looks bad don t worry We re going to show you how to counteract the negative effects of sitting without totally altering your lifestyle Photo by John O Nolan Counteract the Consequences of Sitting and Still Maintain Your Current Lifestyle Happlily you only need to do two things to counter the effects of sitting all day Remember to stand once an hour Get about 30 minutes of activity per day Whether you re a couch potato watching marathons of Firefly or an office worker sitting in front of a computer an Australian study suggests short breaks from sitting once an hour can alleviate most of the problems described above This isn t about working out which is positive in its own right but doesn t counteract the effects of long periods of sitting It s about creating pockets of moderate activity throughout the day and giving your body a respite from sitting What exactly is moderate activity I talked with Dr Brian Parr associate professor in the Department of Exercise and Health Sciences at the University of South Carolina Aiken to find out He points out the distinction between moderate activity and exercise We usually tell people moderate activity is equivalent to a brisk walk This would include yard work or cleaning your house anything that gets you moving counts You don t have to do what people think of as exercise Of course couch potatoes and office workers don t always have thirty minutes to spare After all a Firefly bender might take up an entire evening Here s the good news you can break up that thirty minutes throughout the day Dr Parr continues This is the best part We usually tell people to break it up into ten minute segments but that s because it s the most practical If I tell you that you can spread it out throughout the day you re going to say Well I stood up and walked across the room to my soda What was that about ten seconds You ll start to micromanage From my perspective that s not how people should do it But you could do it that way The main reason you want to shoot for the ten minute chunks is because you re creating a mini stress in your body that helps increase your endurance In the real world this means you won t get tired halfway up the stairs Think of it this way you don t train for a marathon by sprinting for ten minutes every day Instead you increase your endurance with longer jogs The same goes for daily activity you want to sustain activity for long enough to make it useful in your daily life Let s look at how you can estimate your daily activity and make sure you get out of the office chair throughout the day Photo by cell105 Start by Finding Your Daily Baseline with a Pedometer The first thing to do is track how much activity you get in a regular day For me the easiest way to do this is a pedometer that tracks the number of footsteps I take You can purchase a cheap 3 pedometer like this one from Amazon or use an app on your iPhone or Android The first step is to take a 30 minute walk and see how many steps you take My total was a little short of 4 000 Yours will vary based on how quickly you walk and how large your steps are Next you want to find a baseline of your daily activity Start using the pedometer when you wake up in the morning and keep it in your pocket or running on your phone until you go to bed This will give you an estimate of your regular daily activity For me this was frighteningly low on the days I didn t purposely exercise My total number of steps Under 2 000 This is downright horrible and equates to less than a mile a day Clearly I need to get up and move around more often Photo by Adam Engelhart Meet Your Daily Activity Target by Slightly Altering Your Behavior If you re like me you re well under your target exercise range A few simple changes to your daily behavior will help you reach your goal Here are a few ideas for how to do it without really trying Park near the back of the parking lot Stand up to visit the file cabinet instead of rolling your chair Walk over and talk to a coworker instead of emailing them Take the scenic route to the bathroom instead of the most direct Since I work from home I have to make a more concentrated effort to meet these goals I ve started walking to a nearby coffee shop in the afternoon and I hop on an indoor bicycle for at least 10 20 minutes a day If all else fails I ll do laundry because I have to walk down two sets of stairs Meeting your target activity level is just the first step The second part is much simpler and only requires you stand up now and again Here s how I remind myself to do it Photo by o5com Set an Hourly Standing Alarm to Remind You to Stand We know that if you stand up for just one or two minutes every hour it can reduce the negative effect of sitting all day Technically you don t even have to move the act of standing alone helps When you re in the moment and working hard it s difficult to remember I found enabling the hourly announcement in OS X the best reminder To set this click Settings Date Time Announce the time Windows users can set up a similar hourly reminder as a task by clicking Control Panel Administrative Tools Task Scheduler If the alarm isn t enough you can download dedicated software to remind you Windows users can use free programs like Workrave or Breaker to set up automated alerts For Macs Time Out seems the best free option These programs will remind you to stand and dim the desktop to force you out of your chair It s up to you how you use these micro breaks You don t even have to move if you don t want to but if you want to get a little activity in that minute here s a quick way to do it without leaving your desk area Stand up March in place for twenty seconds Reach down and try to touch your toes for twenty seconds Wander around and pick up or reorganize for the last twenty seconds eventually your desk area may even be clean I also set up an iCade at a standing level so I have something to occupy me when I stand up Personally I need objectives and I m not good at just idling for a few minutes The iCade adds a sense of purpose if I don t want to stretch Turn those Crappy Commercials into an Excuse to Get Up TV commercials suck Instead of wasting time watching the same car commercial you ve seen for the last 20 years consider the commercial break a chance to stand and stretch To help me find constructive things to do during commercials or the credits when I m in the midst Netflix marathon I keep a to do list on the coffee table as opposed to at my desk This works as a gentle reminder to take out the trash do the dishes clean the litter box or whatever else needs to get done The best part I don t have to watch commercials On a similar note when playing video games online I use the end of a match as a notification to stand up If I m playing a single player game I stand during loading screens The point is that most of the activities we sit down to enjoy have these types of natural breaks in them If you re reading you can stand up after a chapter or two If you re playing board games you can stand up after each match Instead of sitting and turning your mind off stand and do it It s really that simple Photo by annethelibrarian The moral here is two fold stand up once an hour and get at least 30 minutes of activity in a day That s it Unless you re overweight you don t have to start exercising or going to the gym to counteract the negative effects of sitting You just have to make sure you re moving throughout the day You don t even have to give up your TV marathons you just need to accent them with a little hourly effort health, exercise, sitting, office, sedentary, feature, lifehacker do you sit in an office chair or on your couch for more than six

another diet busting recipe really I am I m not intentionally trying to sway you from your positive eating habits but we all know the Superbowl is coming up and it s not a day to snack on fruits and vegetables It s a day of indulgence so enjoy it for what it is Now I m sure the title of this post intrigued most of you many of you have probably had Auntie Annes Pretzels It s impossible to walk through the mall and not get hit with that amazing aroma of fresh pretzels baking in the oven It gets me every time So when I came across this recipe that claimed to have an exact replica of Auntie Annes Pretzels I was admittedly a little skeptical at first How can someone honestly recreate this amazing one of a kind recipe Well I decided to give it a try and see for myself how authentic it really is and let me tell you this is the real deal Soft chewy center with a perfect crust if I can even call it that Pretzels don t quite have a crust It s more of a flexible dense bite I can t quite put it into words but you know what I m talking about well the baking soda bath is the trick to getting that pretzel stand authenticity Whether you like the traditional salted pretzel dipped in mustard or the sinfully delicious cinnamon and sugar pretzel dipped in icing you have the instructions here to make them Hope you enjoy them Quick side note Stephanie at Steph s Bite By Bite is organizing an Online Bake Auction to raise money for her Team In Training efforts to benefit the Leukemia Lymphoma Society The auction is being held Monday January 31st starting at 7 00 am EST through 9 00pm EST Please check out her link here to find out more details Many fellow food bloggers are donating baked goods to be auctioned and I ll be donating my Baked Doughnut Holes topped with powdered sugar cinnamon sugar glazed and rolled in sprinkles Please stop by the auction to help support a good cause Recipe TipsI recommend serving your pretzels immediately If you have to wait I would imagine the same day is fine too but the next day the plastic wrap had trapped the moister making them soggy while the uncovered pretzels hardened Begin with combining 1 1 2 cups of warm water and yeast into the bowl of an electric mixer Using a spoon gently stir until your yeast dissolves Then add your brown sugar Salt And stir until dissolved Then add your all purpose flour and bread flour Using the paddle attachment mix on low for about 10 seconds until combined Switch your attachment to the dough hook And mix on high for 5 minutes to knead your dough If you don t have an electric mixer you can knead by hand Lightly grease a large pot by brushing the bottom and sides of the pan with olive oil Place your ball of dough in the center of your pot cover it and let it sit for 1 hour in a warm space to rise I keep my oven at 350 degrees and place the pot on top of the stove Immediately after making your dough prepare your baking soda bath in a large mixing bowl by combining 2 cups of warm water Add 2 tablespoons of baking soda Stir until dissolved and continue to stir regularly while the dough is rising Once your dough has doubled in size Put it on a pastry mat and remove a section of dough about 3 4 cup in size You can break off as large or as small of a piece as you like depending on the pretzel size you want to make Roll your section of dough into a long 1 2 inch thick string of dough The length will vary depending on how big you want your pretzel but the thickness should be no bigger than 1 2 inch in diameter When rolling the dough I found it helpful not flouring my work surface and lightly wetting my hands with water not soaking wet To get the right shape roll the dough up and down with your hands all the while pushing from the center out to get a long and narrow string of dough That s what worked for me but you ll find a good rhythm of your own too I m sure Once you have your long string of dough bring one end to the center letting it hang slightly over the edge Then bring your other end over and weave it underneath the first loop to get a pretty knot Then dip your pretzel into the baking soda bath water making sure to hold its shape in place Then lay it on a well greased cookie sheet Lay them with about 1 1 2 inches in between each other Preheat your oven to 450 degrees and let your pretzels sit for 15 20 minutes before baking to allow for a second rise Bake at 450 degrees for 10 minutes or until golden brown Meanwhile prepare your dipping ingredients Melt about 4 tablespoons of butter Then mix your sugar and cinnamon together if you re making cinnamon sugar pretzels To make an icing glaze to dip your cinnamon sugar pretzels in combine your powdered sugar and water together in a bowl Mix until combined and set aside for dipping When your pretzels are cool enough to handle generously brush them all over with your melted butter Then dip in your cinnamon sugar mixture until coated Or sprinkle with sea salt Serve your traditional pretzel

having breakfast for dinner Dessert for breakfast And lunch for well lunch I guess My husband and I were recently given a few garden fresh poblano peppers and I instantly knew what I was going to make with them I ve had this recipe brewing in my brain for a while now And since poblanos are pretty agreeable with most people s pallets being that they re not too spicy deliciously smoky when roasted and ummm awesome I thought today is the day we are having breakfast for dinner So I cranked out some delicious stuffed breakfast poblanos OH And a huge THANK YOU to Ken for hooking us up with these peppers They were the bomb Preheat the broiler on high then wash and place on a foil lined parchment paper Once your oven is ready to go place the sheet pan on the middle rack and roast until charred About 15 20 minutes just be sure to rotate them half way every 5 7 minutes to get them charred all over Oh And please use tin foil because broiler parchment paper you re homeless How could I forget this So you re going to need some onions peppers and garlic Why all that jazz is going on in the oven I diced up half of the red onion yellow onion and red pepper Keep the dice on the small side for even cooking k Remove the peppers once they are blistered and charred As you can see I didn t burn the house down phew Immediately place them in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap or place in a paper bag and close it tight so it can do its thing While the peppers are steaming place 8 whole eggs into a bowl I like to use a measuring cup it makes for easy pouring and less of a chance I spill it all over the place Pour in a little heavy cream I eyeball it but around 2 tablespoons In a large pan over medium heat I added a little olive oil and sauteed the onions sprinkled with a little kosher salt until soft translucent In goes the peppers and garlic Stir for one minute until the garlic is slightly golden Helllloooo chorizo Now you re not going to need a whole pound of this only about a third I wrap the rest of it up and freeze it for later This chorizo is a Mexican style ground pork sausage that is usually made with chili peppers My chorizo says that it s HOT but I didn t think so but use whatever heat level you re comfortable with Throw in a third of a pound Cook it all the way through then reduce the heat to low Once the pan had a chance to cool down slowly pour the eggs directly into the sausage and onion mixture Cook the eggs low and slow scraping the pan until the eggs are scrambled Remove off of the heat and set aside to cool a tad Now the peppers should be all steamed and ready to be peeled I m not going to lie to you and say it s easy It did take me about 20 minutes to peel and remove all the seeds for these four peppers I m sure with practice it would or could get better What I can tell you is that you don t need gloves for these peppers just take your time I made a long slit to get in and remove the seeds then I carefully turned the pepper inside out and scraped out any stragglers They may tear a little but that s okay nobody will care once they see what s for dinner or breakfast Brinner No That s dorky Stuff each pepper with a quarter of the egg mixture If there are some eggs left over I maybe had a couple spoonfuls just go ahead and eat it Seriously don t waste the stuff It s gold Top with some freshly grated pepper jack cheese Monterey Jack is fine too I use about a quarter cup shredded on each pepper Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for about 20 25 minutes or until the cheese is melted and golden I threw on my broiler for a few instead of adding on extra time I was hungry and I wanted these peppers N O W My husband topped his with a little Cholula hot sauce I liked mine with a little chopped cilantro These were over the top delicious I served my stuffed pepper with some marinated tomatoes and it was the perfect dinner I really wish you could taste this Next time I m making a double batch and invite ya over Ingredients 4

contracts over the years have gotten so extreme that they make even wealthy people envious It wasn t always like this this era of contracts started in the late 80 s with Kirby Puckett being the first player to receive a 3 million dollar contract in 1989 according to the Sporting News That might not seem like a lot but for MLB it was a great deal at that time And it did not stop there That was just what opened the flood gates Here s a detailed breakdown of the 25 biggest and most expensive sports contracts ever signed in descending order 1 Jason Giambi New York Yankees Baseball 120 000 000 These days Jason Giambi seems more of a DH than a power hitting first baseman That said he was once the power hitting first baseman for the Oakland Athletics but when Mark McQuire was traded in 1997 Jason became the first baseman In 2003 Giambi was named in the Balco investigation blemishing his otherwise promising career Since then he apologized to the organization as well as the fans and promised to return to his previous form 2 Shaquille O Neal Los Angeles Lakers Basketball 120 000 000 Shaquille O Neal originally played college basketball for the LSU tigers He is probably one of the biggest players in the NBA to come along since Kareem Abdul Jabbar or Wilt Chamberlain and we re not referring to his stature The contract in question was signed in 1996 and ran through the 2003 season and made NBA history Shaq as he is endearingly called spent the first 4 years of his career with the Orlando Magic where he helped them win 20 more games than in the previous year and made his first NBA All Star game in1993 Shaq is also one of the few players that has a better average shooting field goals 581 lifetime than he does with free throws 524 lifetime 3 Mike Hampton Colorado Rockies Baseball 121 000 000 Mike Hampton signed an 8 year deal with the Colorado Rockies worth 121 000 000 in 2001 What s interesting about this deal is that Hampton hasn t even pitched extensively since August 19 2005 He faced several injuries in 2005 and underwent Tommy Johns surgery to repair his throwing arm In 2002 a year after the contract was signed the Rockies traded him to the Florida Marlins who then proceeded to trade him to the Atlanta Braves Once in Atlanta Mike was able to work with then pitching coach Leo Mazzone who helped him get out of the funk he had gotten himself into while in Colorado 4 Tim Duncan San Antonio Spurs Basketball 122 007 704 Tim Duncan s contract runs through the 2010 season with the San Antonio Spurs Tim was born on the US Virgin Island of Saint Croix and is still featured prominently on billboards all over St Croix Duncan was originally picked in the 1997 draft by the Spurs after a stellar college career for the Wake Forest Demon Decons Tim Duncan s entire professional career has been with this one team which in today s sports is remarkable in itself Tim holds many awards including the 1998 NBA Rookie of the year 2002 and 2003 NBA MVP 1999 2003 and 2005 NBA Finals MVP and a 4 time NBA Champion He was on the winning team in 1999 2003 2005 and 2007 5 Chris Webber Sacramento Kings Basketball 122 718 750 Chris Webber might be best known as a member of the famed Fab Five for the Michigan Wolverines This group of five outstanding players all entered into college in 1991 and took their team to the finals twice but did not win In the 1993 draft he was selected by the Orlando Magic who then proceeded to trade him to the Golden State Warriors Chris played there through 1994 when he was traded to the Washington Bullets where he played until 1998 In May of that year Chris was traded again this time he was going to the Sacramento Kings In 2001 the Kings locked him into a 7 year deal but traded him once again in 2005 this time to Philidephia Chris is still playing today as he has come full circle playing in 2008 for the Golden State Warriors 6 Alexander Ovechkin Washington Capitals Ice hockey 124 000 000 This is by far the longest contract that made this list In 2008 the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League signed Alexander Ovechkin to the biggest contract of the league He was originally drafted by the Capitals in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft first overall Due to the 2004 05 NHL lockout Ovechkin did not start playing in the NHL until the 2005 season but when he did start playing he became the first rookie that was named to the NHL First All Star Team in 15 years Overchkin s performance and therefore his value continued to rise the more he played and continued to set records and collect rewards On January 13 2008 ESPN reported that Ovechkin and Washington Capital had come to terms on this 13 year contract for 124 million 7 Michael Schumacher Ferrari Auto racing 124 000 000 In 1996 Michael Schumacher and Ferrari

time list 10 Barry Zito San Francisco Giants Baseball 126 000 000 Barry Zito locked into a 7 year deal with the San Francisco Giants worth 126 million dollars Barry has become one of the dominant left

college days at USC after transferring from Los Angeles Pierce College and UC Santa Barbara before that Barry was drafted again by the Oakland Athletics in 1999 and made major league debut against the

and was the first player since Moses Malone to be drafted right out of high school since 1974 Minnesota decided that this would be their Franchise Player but they became increasingly frustrated with him starting in 2004 and through 2007 due to issues with the team and their inability to win On July 31st of 2007 all of that was remedied as Kevin was traded to the Boston Celtics Ironically enough he would go on to win a NBA Championship with the Boston Celtics in 2008 12 Jermaine O Neal Indiana Pacers Basketball 126 558 000 Jermaine O Neal is another player that never graced the floor of a college basketball team A 6 11 he declared his NBA eligibility in the 1996 draft He was taken 17th overall by the Portland Trail Blazers that year From the day O Neal entered the league till the time he was traded to the Indiana Pacer O Neal believed that he was treated unfairly O Neal spent most of his time in Portland on their bench and was eventually traded to the Pacers where he debuted as a starter in the 2001 season The Pacers were so impressed with O Neal that on Jul 16 2003 they decided to give Jermaine a six year deal that held a value of 126 558 000 13 Peyton Manning Indianapolis Colts Football 132 500 000 Peyton Manning got his long term contract in 2005 when he signed on with the Indianapolis Colts Peyton had already spent 7 years in Indianapolis as the Colts quarterback and in 2004 he would have a record setting season which was one of the main reasons the Colts wanted to desperately lock him in for the remainder of his career While still in college Manning had amassed 11 201 yards and 89 touchdowns winning 39 of 45 games as a starter and becoming the Volunteer s all time leading passer His highlights records and awards would not stop there though In 2006 the Colts had their best season yet as Peyton led them to a Superbowl Championship against the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI 14 Alfonso Soriano Chicago Cubs Baseball 136 000 000 Alfonso Soriano has made a name for himself during the New York Yankee years as their lead off hitter He has made the 30 30 club the 40 40 club and is part of the Top 500 home run hitters of all time just to name a few of his achievements so far 2001 was Soriano s rookie year and he finished third in the Rookie of the Year award In 2004 Alfonso was traded to the Texas Rangers along with a minor leaguer for Alex Rodriguez

million dollars which he accepted 15 Kobe Bryant Los Angeles Lakers Basketball 136 400 000 Kobe Bryant s 7 year contract with the Los Angeles Lakers gives him the title of the most expensive

drafted out of high school in 1996 giving him instant notoriety Kobe s contract came around the same time that the Lakers decided it was time to part ways with Shaquille O Neal in favor of building their team around Kobe Unfortunately the Lakers have not won another NBA Championship since then even as Kobe has ammassed numerous awards and achievements 16 Johan Santana New York Mets Baseball 137 500 000 Johan Santana had one of the biggest and most talked about trade potentials in baseball s off season The New York Mets signed him to a 6 year 137 million dollar contract that would make him the highest paid pitcher in the Major Leagues And well deserved when you look at what he can do to an offense Santana debuted with the Minnesota Twins on April 3 2000 and came out of the bullpen against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays as they were known then He got his first major league start against the Kansas City Royals on August 7 2000 Santana holds a 3 29 career ERA that teams lovem and

Florida Marlins by hitting a walk off home run in his first major league game on June 20 2003 He was just 20 years old His bat was so good that he was very instrumental in the playoffs for the Florida Marlins and was a huge part of them beating the Yankees that year Miguel would end up on the cover of the ESPN magazine during the off season due to his exceptional statistics which showed no signs of tapering off In December of 2007 the Marlins agreed on a deal that would send Cabrera and team mate Dontrelle Willis to the Tigers for 6 players In March of 2008 Miguel Cabrera and the Detroit Tigers

000 One of only 2 baseball players with a 10 year contract Derek Jeter started his career as a Yankee in 1992 as he was drafted 6th overall and has always worn the pinstripes He has earned himself the

major contract in Texas when he became a free agent after the 2000 season was over The Texas Rangers needed someone to build their team around after hitting rock bottom and Alex seemed like the perfect player for the job Unfortunately however A Rod did not seem to be working for Texas as in 2001 and 2002 they still finished in the cellar of their division It was time to let Alex go and Texas did exactly that right before the start of the 2004 season 25 Alex Rodriguez New York Yankees Baseball 275 000 000 One of only 2 baseball players with a 10 year contract Alex was originally traded to the Yankees on February 15 2004 to replace a void created when then third baseman Aaron Boone injured his knee in a pick up game of basketball This injury put him out for the entire year Furthermore Texas had already been looking for a place to dump Alex and his enormous salary and this was just the opening that they had wanted The re signing of Rodriquez was strange to say the least as he would be opting out of his 252 million dollar 10 year contract Lucky for him the New York Yankees picked him up soon after and signed him to a new 10 year contract worth 275 million sports contracts over the years have gotten so extreme that they make even wealthy people envious. it wasn't always like this, this era of contracts started in business-general,jobs,sports"",""url"":""businesspundit 25

Egg RollsBy SteamyKitchen 65 comments These are my Mom s Famous Crispy Chinese Egg Rolls and a recipe that I published way back in 2007 but somehow got lost in the Internet void Thank goodness that this recipe was part of my cookbook so I still had the text and photos Jaden This is one of those recipes that is a little more time consuming to make but one that s my favorite because 1 it s my Mom s recipe 2 everyone who has tried them instantly declare they are the best they ve ever had 3 you can make a big batch of them and freeze them I usually call a couple of my girlfriends over and we have an eggrollin party where we ll make a massive batch of them enjoy them fresh that night and have enough for all to take home and freeze If you are making these with friends I d suggest doubling the recipe so each person has some to take home to freeze I promise you they will taste just as good fried after frozen and you will never taste better egg rolls than these BUT you must follow my Mama s rules Ready Mama s Rule 1 Your egg roll filling ingredients must be drained of excess moisture and cooled before rolling Soggy hot filling makes soggy egg rolls Mama s Rule 2 Use the right kind of wrapper The size I get is 8 x 8 inches 20 x 20 cm around and come 25 wrappers to a package These wrappers are light paper thin and fry up to a shatteringly crisp crunch Oh yes before I forget spring roll and egg roll are interchangeable and mean the same thing Sometimes my regular American grocery store will have spring roll pasta sheets that are in the refrigerated produce section Do not use those they are way too thick Let s just say that if it has Italian writing on the package it probably ain t the good stuff for Chinese egg rolls Rule 2A Treat the wrapper right You also want to keep the wrappers covered with a damp towel at all times to prevent the edges from drying and cracking Mama s Rule 3 Roll small and tight Sloppy and loosely rolled egg rolls will break apart and allow oil to seep into the inside of the roll Mama says baaaad One time I was watching a celebrity chef on television making monster egg rolls the size of a cola can Who in the heck can wrap their mouths around that thing It looked hideous Mama s egg rolls are elegant and skinny Don t be too greedy and overstuff them And roll them tight so that the filling doesn t fall out while frying Remember the days when you were younger and rolled your own um cigarette Channel those rolling skills back Mama s Rule 4 Lay the rolled egg rolls neatly with a piece of parchment foil or wax paper in between each layer if you are stacking them on top of each other Keep them covered with plastic wrap or a towel to prevent drying If you are freezing freeze them in like this first Once frozen you can gather them up and transfer them to a plastic freezer bag If you roll them out and jumble them all together in a big pile they ll eventually stick to each other and you ll tear the delicate skin trying to pry them apart The printable recipe is below but here are step by step photos on how to wrap The recipe is for ground pork as the filling but as you can see in these photos the filling is very flexible I ve used chopped shrimp ground chicken ground beef ground turkey very thinly sliced pork almost like matchstick sized In these photos I used crawfish and diced Chinese sausage These photos are just a guideline to teach you how to wrap and the wrong way to wrap Chinese Egg Rolls After you fry the filling you ll want to spread it out to cool on a baking sheet Tilt the baking sheet and prop it up so that all the juices accumulate You ll discard this juice Too much juice in filling makes soggy eggrolls Lay the wrapper on a clean dry surface as shown Spoon just a heaping tablespoon of filling near the bottom corner Resist the urge to over stuff with too much filling Lift the bottom corner up and begin rolling until you reach halfway up Fold over the left side and then the right side towards the center Continue folding up with a tuck roll tuck roll motion Dip your fingers into the cornstarch slurry and brush all over the final top corner Finish up the roll and seal See how tightly the egg roll wrapped Any holes or large air pockets will allow oil to seep in resulting in a greasy egg roll The width or diameter of the egg roll should ONLY be 1 25 inches If you make them any larger i e too much filling you ll end up with less egg rolls The wrong way Common mistake is to not fold over and tuck good enough See that big space Oil seeps in and will make your egg roll greasy Big holes your egg roll will fall apart while frying See the difference between the above photo and this one Servings Makes 50 egg rolls Prep Time Cook Time Once you make these egg rolls you ll never make them any other way Make sure you get the correct egg roll wrappers They should be FROZEN and very thin almost paper thin Do not use egg roll wrapper found in the refrigerated section usually near tofu in Western supermarket they make starchy thick gooey egg rolls with big bubbles on outside when you fry It s important to make sure you keep your wrapper and rolled egg rolls under plastic wrap so that they do not dry out Ingredients 50 Spring Egg Roll Wrappers about 2 packages defrosted unopened at room temperature for 45 minutes or in the refrigerator overnight1 tablespoon cornstarch or flour mixed with \u00bc cup of cool waterOil for fryingFOR THE GROUND PORK1 pound ground pork1 tablespoon soy sauce1 teaspoon cornstarch1 4 teaspoon sugarfreshly ground black pepperFOR THE VEGETABLES2 to 3 cloves garlic very finely minced\u00bd head of cabbage about 11 ounces 3 carrots shredded1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger10 fresh shiitake mushrooms or dried black mushrooms soaked overnight stems discarded1 tablespoon cooking oil canola vegetable peanut 1 tablespoon Chinese rice wine1 tablespoon soy sauce1 4 teaspoon sugar1 2 teaspoon salt1 teaspoon sesame oilFreshly ground black pepperDirections 1 To make the filling combine the ingredients for the ground pork together Marinate at least 10 minutes In the meantime shred the cabbage and the carrots using your food processor or by hand Slice the mushrooms into very thin strips or you could use your food processer and pulse a few times to get a fine dice 2 Heat a wok or large saute pan over high heat Add the cooking oil and swirl to coat Add the pork and stir fry until no longer pink about 2 3 minutes Turn heat to medium low push the meat to one side of the pan Add the garlic cabbage carrots ginger and the mushrooms and stir fry for 1 minute until the vegetables are softened Add the rice wine soy sauce sugar sesame oil and black pepper Continue to stir fry for another minute Scoop out the filling to a baking sheet and spread out to cool Prop up one end of the baking sheet so that it tilts and will allow all the moisture to drain to one end Let cool for 15 minutes 3 Discard all of the accumulated juices Use paper towels to blot the filling to rid of extra oil or juice Now you re ready to wrap see photos for instructions on how to wrap IMPORTANT Only use 1 heaping tablespoon of filling for each egg roll These are slender egg rolls the width of the egg roll should only be 1 25 diameter Keep the rolled egg rolls in neat single layer and covered with plastic wrap to prevent drying If you want to stack the egg rolls make sure you have layer of parchment paper in between the layers to prevent sticking Keep wrappers also covered with plastic wrap to prevent drying Refrigerate up to 4 hours until ready to fry or freeze 4 To fry the egg rolls fill a wok or pot with 2 inches of high heat cooking oil Heat the oil to 350 F 175 C or until a cube of bread will fry to golden brown within 10 seconds Gently slide in or lower the egg rolls frying 4 to 6 at a time turning occasionally until golden brown about 1\u00bd minutes Place on wire rack to drain and cool NOTE To fry frozen egg rolls do not defrost the egg rolls just add them to the oil frozen frying 4 to 6 at a time Add an additional 1\u00bd minutes to the frying time since they are frozen Other Egg Roll Spring Roll Recipes Red Lantern

night Eric and I got dressed up me as the Queen of Hearts him as the Scream character and we stuffed 40 treat bags for the trick or treaters They were bursting with candy and small toys like leap frogs and mini games Last year we got around 20 kids so we doubled the quantity in case there was an influx of kids We did it up Halloween music was pumping through the upstairs window and our black light was flashing A mild headache ensued My poufy sleeves really started to itch my arms but I persisted on and had another sip of my spiked cider Eric said he couldn t breathe through his mask removing it every once and a while to gasp for air No biggie Then we waited And you know what Not one kid came to our door What has the world come to these days Are there no kids trick or treating anymore It was like a ghost town out there Needless to say Eric s coworkers will be overjoyed when they see all the treat bags he s brought them today I don t think anyone is getting much work done today unless buzzing around the office on a sugar high and playing leap frog counts Luckily we had this soup to comfort us last night The Queen of Hearts and Scream characters sat at the table and enjoyed a delicious bowl of soup and crispy garlic bread Sometimes that s all you need I ve made this soup twice in one week and the second time I doubled the recipe after deeming the first version produced too little soup I posted the doubled recipe below If you re a mushroom fan you will go crazy for this meaty and ultra hearty soup It honestly makes me drool to look at these pictures because I love it so much Normal right Saut\u00e9 some garlic and onion for about 5 minutes Don t all amazing recipes start this way Then add in your sliced mushrooms and cook it down for about 15 20 minutes Meanwhile cook some millet in a pot Quinoa would also work nicely too Add your broth seasonings and simmer for about 5 more minutes At this point I scooped half of my soup into the blender and processed it until lightly smooth Then I poured this mixture back into the pot with the remaining soup I loved this method because it thickens up the soup very nicely but still left big mushroom pieces to bite into Of course if you have a hand held immersion blender that would work even better a food processor would work too but be sure to leave it chunky for the best texture Now stir in the cooked millet This thickens it up nicely too And you re done Feel free to spoon into mason jars for portable work lunches I also made some Cheezy garlic bread based off a recipe in Eat Drink Be Vegan To make Slice a baguette in halfPeel a garlic clove and cut it in half and rub the garlic all over the bread This helps infuse the garlic flavour into the bread without it being overpowering You can also use garlic powder or garlic salt Spread on some Earth Balance or other non dairy spread Followed by a sprinkle of nutritional yeast for the cheezy flavour and kosher saltBake at 350F for about 14 15 minutes until crispy and golden Slice serve warm This was amazing I don t even want to tell you how many pieces I had I think I ploughed through a quarter of the baguette Why are baguettes so insanely good By the way my tests came back normal so gluten is here to stay I ll be talking about this more in a future post though Mushroom Millet Soup Vegan Gluten Free Low fat Hearty meaty and filling pair this with homemade garlic bread and you ve got a healthy Fall meal that will make you forget all about summer Yield Approx 7 cupsIngredients 1 cup uncooked millet or quinoa for complete protein 2 pounds fresh cremini mushrooms sliced4 cups chopped sweet onion4 garlic cloves minced7 5 cups low sodium vegetable broth if using full sodium reduce added salt below Salt pepper to taste I used about 1 5 tsp kosher salt 2 tbsp vegan GF Wizard s Worchester sauce or equivalent To garnish toasted walnuts fresh herbs etc 1 Preheat oven to 350F Line a baking sheet with parchment paper 2 Prepare your millet I used these directions and fluff with a fork and set aside 3 Meanwhile in a large pot over medium low heat add a bit of oil 1 tsp along with the chopped onion and minced garlic Sautee for about 5 minutes until transparent stirring frequently 4 Stir in broth along with seasonings salt pepper Worchester sauce Add only about half of the salt to begin adding the rest to taste right before serving Simmer over medium heat for about 5 minutes 5 Scoop half of the mixture into a blender and blend until almost smooth but still a bit chunky Add back into the pot Alternatively you can use an immersion blender but be sure to leave it nice and chunky 6 Stir in cooked millet Season to taste and serve with a garnish of toasted walnuts garlic bread fresh parsley or anything that you like Late last night we headed out for our evening walk A nice older lady who lives down the street had made a cute Halloween display for the kids at the end of her driveway There was a sign taped to a haystack that read Please help yourself to the candy but no candy to be found We walked down the road a bit and there was a RACCOON with her bowl of candy happily munching away on a Snickers bar in front of her yard At least someone s enjoying Halloween imagine this scene: last night, eric and i got dressed up (me as the queen of hearts, him as the scream character) and we stuffed 40 treat bags

"http://www.thefrugalgirl.com/?p=2822"	"8083"	"{""title"":""Wednesday Baking Overnight Cinnamon Twists "",""body"":""Note This recipe will be unnecessarily picture heavy since I m dearly in love with my new camera lens If you read me on dial up you might want to stop reading and come back tomorrow This is a recipe I ve been making since I was a teenager It s from an old Fleischmann s Yeast cookbook that my mom got before I was born it s now on um permanent loan to me I think There s no date on it but judging by this picture of the then current family of Fleischmann products it s been around for a while But it has some really good recipes in it one of which I ll share with you today The most delightful thing about this recipe is that everything except the baking can be done the day night before which means that you can enjoy fresh cinnamony goodness for breakfast without having to get up at 4 30 So while you might be willing to get up at the crack of dawn to make this for breakfast you don t have to Here s how to avoid baking before the sun comes up Mix the dry ingredients Mix the milk water and butter together and heat to 120 130 degrees Fahrenheit Obviously I took this picture before I did any heating Add to the dry ingredients and beat for 2 minutes The dough will be more like batter at this point Add eggs and beat for 2 more minutes Add enough additional flour to make a manageable dough and turn out onto a floured surface Knead 5 10 minutes or until the dough is smooth and elastic Cover with a wet tea towel and let rest 20 minutes It won t rise a lot in 20 minutes but the gluten will relax a bit which will make it much easier to roll the dough out Meanwhile mix up the cinnamon and sugar and melt some butter a couple of tablespoons should be enough If you don t do dairy you can sub whatever oil you prefer to use Divide the rested dough in half and roll each half into a 12 inch square Brush the entire square with melted butter You don t want it to be swimming in butter but be generous enough for the cinnamon sugar to stick Sprinkle 3 tablespoons of the sugar mixture down the center third of the dough Then fold one third of the dough over the center third Sprinkle 3 more tablespoons of the sugar mixture over the remaining buttered third of the dough Fold the two thirds of the dough over the sugared third If you try to fold the sugared third over you ll just make a big mess Repeat with the other square and then cut each buttered and sugared half of the dough into 1 inch strips I find that a pizza cutter is the best tool to use for this I actually don t ever use my pizza cutter for its intended purpose but I do love to have one around for baking Holding each end of a strip twist the ends in opposite directions and place in a greased pan If you have two 9 9 pans use those incidentally does anyone actually own 9 9 pans I ve never seen one in my lifetime Since no 9 9 pans reside in my cupboards I use an 8 8 pan and a 9 13 pan That s not quite equivalent to two 9 9 pans but it works just fine Cover the dough with plastic wrap or if you have lids for your pans you can use those instead My aunt currently has my lidded pan so I had to use plastic wrap today Refrigerate anywhere from 2 to 24 hours The dough will rise the in the fridge for a couple of hours but after that the chill will slow the yeast growth down to a crawl and very little rising will occur after that When you re ready to bake your twists turn your oven on to 350 remove the twists from the fridge uncover them and let them sit at room temperature while the oven heats up 10 20 minutes Bake for 20 30 minutes depending on the size of your pan An 8 8 pan won t need to bake quite as long as a 9 13 pan obviously Cool in the pan on a wire rack before eating If you re not satisfied with the level of sugar in this recipe you can drizzle confectioner s icing over top Mixing this up takes all of about 60 seconds You just combine powdered sugar a bit of milk and a bit of vanilla Easy peasy And then you drizzle it over the top of the warm twists like so Could we just pause for a moment and admire this loveliness of this picture which was of course taken with my new lens I m a happy girl If you re done gazing at the picture read on for the actual recipe Overnight Cinnamon Twists Dough 5 6 cups all purpose flour1 2 cup sugar1 1 2 teaspoons salt2 pkg 4 1 2 teaspoons active dry yeast1 cup milk2 3 cup water1 4 cup butter cut into smallish chunks this makes it easier to melt 2 eggs3 4 cup raisins I don t include these Filling3 4 cup sugar2 teaspoons cinnamon Icing optional 1 cup powdered sugar1 tablespoon milk1 4 teaspoon vanilla 1 In the bowl of a stand mixer combine 2 cups flour and the sugar salt and yeast 2 Combine milk water and butter and heat in microwave or in a saucepan until very warm 120 130 degrees F 3 Gradually add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and beat two minutes at medium speed Add eggs and beat at high speed 2 minutes Stir in raisins if using and enough additional flour to make a soft but kneadable dough 4 Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic 5 10 minutes Place dough back in bowl cover with a wet tea towel and let rest 20 minutes 5 While the dough is resting combine 3 4 sugar and 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon and melt several tablespoons of butter 6 After 20 minutes divide dough in half Roll out each half into a 12 inch square Brush with melted butter Sprinkle center third of each square with 3 tablespoons of the sugar mixture Fold one third over center third Sprinkle with 3 tablespoons of the sugar mixture Fold remaining third over the two layers Using a pizza cutter cut the dough into strips about 1 inch wide Take hold of each end of strip and twist tightly in opposite directions Arrange in two greased 9 inch square pans or an 8 8 pan and a 9 13 pan like I do Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 2 to 24 hours 7 When ready to bake heat oven to 350 and remove pans from fridge Uncover dough and let stand at room temperature 10 20 minutes Bake 20 30 minutes or until browned A 9 13 pan will take closer to 30 minutes and an 8 8 or 9 9 pan will

Chapter 7 is generally the least complicated way to use bankruptcy to get control of your financial life.  Unless you are trying to save a home or you earn too much, chapter 7 bankruptcy is almost always the best option for you.  It is important to consult with a knowledgeable attorney to determine which chapter of the bankruptcy code is right for you.\nHow does a Chapter 7 bankruptcy work?\n\nYour bankruptcy petition, which we prepare for you and file with the Court, begins your bankruptcy case.  Whenever you begin a bankruptcy case, the law requires that you provide the Court with a comprehensive picture of your financial condition.  The information that we include in the petition we prepare for you includes your income, your expenses, a list of your assets, and a list of your creditors and how much you owe them.  As we prepare your petition, we will also discuss with you your finances and provide you advice and counsel.  We continue to advise and support you and communicate with you throughout your bankruptcy case.\nBankruptcy Attorney Las Vegas\n\nBefore you file bankruptcy you must also take a consumer credit counseling course.  Most people choose to take this class online.\n\nPart of the chapter 7 bankruptcy process includes the appointment of a bankruptcy trustee.  The trustee's job is to make sure that your case is handled properly.  One of the trustee's tasks is to review your assets to determine whether any of your assets can be used to pay something to your creditors.  In Nevada, most people can generally keep much if not all of their property in a chapter 7 bankruptcy.  It is very important that your attorney take the time to discuss with you your assets in order to determine what the law protects (exempt assets) and what the law gives to the trustee (non-exempt assets).\n\nOnce you file a chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, you will need to attend a meeting of creditors about 30 days later.  The trustee runs this meeting, and your creditors are invited to attend.  During this meeting the trustee will ask you questions about the information in your petition and make sure you have provided all of the necessary paperwork.\n\nBankruptcy Attorney Las Vegas\n\nIn order to receive your discharge, you will also need to take a second online course, a debtor education course, after we file your bankruptcy petition for you.\n\nAfter you receive your discharge, usually about 3 to 4 months after you file your case, your debts (except for some debts like student loans and some taxes) are no longer enforceable against you.\n\nBankruptcy Attorney Las Vegas\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=w5MKe5GOK-g Education"",""title"":"""",""url"":""youtube watch""}"	"?"

Sarcoidosis Support Community "",""body"":""The Spoon Theory by Christine Miserandino www butyoudontlooksick com My best friend and I were in the diner talking As usual it was very late and we were eating French fries with gravy Like normal girls our age we spent a lot of time in the diner while in college and most of the time we spent talking about boys music or trivial things that seemed very important at the time We never got serious about anything in particular and spent most of our time laughing As I went to take some of my medicine with a snack as I usually did she watched me with an awkward kind of stare instead of continuing the conversation She then asked me out of the blue what it felt like to have Lupus and be sick I was shocked not only because she asked the random question but also because I assumed she knew all there was to know about Lupus She came to doctors with me she saw me walk with a cane and throw up in the bathroom She had seen me cry in pain what else was there to know I started to ramble on about pills and aches and pains but she kept pursuing and didn t seem satisfied with my answers I was a little surprised as being my roommate in college and friend for years I thought she already knew the medical definition of Lupus Then she looked at me with a face every sick person knows well the face of pure curiosity about something no one healthy can truly understand She asked what it felt like not physically but what it felt like to be me to be sick As I tried to gain my composure I glanced around the table for help or guidance or at least stall for time to think I was trying to find the right words How do I answer a question I never was able to answer for myself How do I explain every detail of every day being effected and give the emotions a sick person goes through with clarity I could have given up cracked a joke like I usually do and changed the subject but I remember thinking if I don t try to explain this how could I ever expect her to understand If I can t explain this to my best friend how could I explain my world to anyone else I had to at least try At that moment the spoon theory was born I quickly grabbed every spoon on the table hell I grabbed spoons off of the other tables I looked at her in the eyes and said Here you go you have Lupus She looked at me slightly confused as anyone would when they are being handed a bouquet of spoons The cold metal spoons clanked in my hands as I grouped them together and shoved them into her hands I explained that the difference in being sick and being healthy is having to make choices or to consciously think about things when the rest of the world doesn t have to The healthy have the luxury of a life without choices a gift most people take for granted Most people start the day with unlimited amount of possibilities and energy to do whatever they desire especially young people For the most part they do not need to worry about the effects of their actions So for my explanation I used spoons to convey this point I wanted something for her to actually hold for me to then take away since most people who get sick feel a loss of a life they once knew If I was in control of taking away the spoons then she would know what it feels like to have someone or something else in this case Lupus being in control She grabbed the spoons with excitement She didn t understand what I was doing but she is always up for a good time so I guess she thought I was cracking a joke of some kind like I usually do when talking about touchy topics Little did she know how serious I would become I asked her to count her spoons She asked why and I explained that when you are healthy you expect to have a never ending supply of spoons But when you have to now plan your day you need to know exactly how many spoons you are starting with It doesn t guarantee that you might not lose some along the way but at least it helps to know where you are starting She counted out 12 spoons She laughed and said she wanted more I said no and I knew right away that this little game would work when she looked disappointed and we hadn t even started yet I ve wanted more spoons for years and haven t found a way yet to get more why should she I also told her to always be conscious of how many she had and not to drop them because she can never forget she has Lupus I asked her to list off the tasks of her day including the most simple As she rattled off daily chores or just fun things to do I explained how each one would cost her a spoon When she jumped right into getting ready for work as her first task of the morning I cut her off and took away a spoon I practically jumped down her throat I said No You don t just get up You have to crack open your eyes and then realize you are late You didn t sleep well the night before You have to crawl out of bed and then you have to make your self something to eat before you can do anything else because if you don t you can t take your medicine and if you don t take your medicine you might as well give up all your spoons for today and tomorrow too I quickly took away a spoon and she realized she hasn t even gotten dressed yet Showering cost her spoon just for washing her hair and shaving her legs Reaching high and low that early in the morning could actually cost more than one spoon but I figured I would give her a break I didn t want to scare her right away Getting dressed was worth another spoon I stopped her and broke down every task to show her how every little detail needs to be thought about You cannot simply just throw clothes on when you are sick I explained that I have to see what clothes I can physically put on if my hands hurt that day buttons are out of the question If I have bruises that day I need to wear long sleeves and if I have a fever I need a sweater to stay warm and so on If my hair is falling out I need to spend more time to look presentable and then you need to factor in another 5 minutes for feeling badly that it took you 2 hours to do all this I think she was starting to understand when she theoretically didn t even get to work and she was left with 6 spoons I then explained to her that she needed to choose the rest of her day wisely since when your spoons are gone they are gone Sometimes you can borrow against tomorrow s spoons but just think how hard tomorrow will be with less spoons I also needed to explain that a person who is sick always lives with the looming thought that tomorrow may be the day that a cold comes or an infection or any number of things that could be very dangerous So you do not want to run low on spoons because you never know when you truly will need them I didn t want to depress her but I needed to be realistic and unfortunately being prepared for the worst is part of a real day for me We went through the rest of the day and she slowly learned that skipping lunch would cost her a spoon as well as standing on a train or even typing at her computer too long She was forced to make choices and think about things differently Hypothetically she had to choose not to run errands so that she could eat dinner that night When we got to the end of her pretend day she said she was hungry I summarized that she had to eat dinner but she only had one spoon left If she cooked she wouldn t have enough energy to clean the pots If she went out for dinner she might be too tired to drive home safely Then I also explained that I didn t even bother to add into this game that she was so nauseous that cooking was probably out of the question anyway So she decided to make soup it was easy I then said it is only 7pm you have the rest of the night but maybe end up with one spoon so you can do something fun or clean your apartment or do chores but you can t do it all I rarely see her emotional so when I saw her upset I knew maybe I was getting through to her I didn t want my friend to be upset but at the same time I was happy to think finally maybe someone understood me a little bit She had tears in her eyes and asked quietly Christine How do you do it Do you really do this everyday I explained that some days were worse then others some days I have more spoons then most But I can never make it go away and I can t forget about it I always have to think about it I handed her a spoon I had been holding in reserve I said simply I have learned to live life with an extra spoon in my pocket in reserve You need to always be prepared Its hard the hardest thing I ever had to learn is to slow down and not do everything I fight this to this day I hate feeling left out having to choose to stay home or to not get things done that I want to I wanted her to feel that frustration I wanted her to understand that everything everyone else does comes so easy but for me it is one hundred little jobs in one I need to think about the weather my temperature that day and the whole day s plans before I can attack any one given thing When other people can simply do things I have to attack it and make a plan like I am strategizing a war It is in that lifestyle the difference between being sick and healthy It is the beautiful ability to not think and just do I miss that freedom I miss never having to count spoons After we were emotional and talked about this for a little while longer I sensed she was sad Maybe she finally understood Maybe she realized that she never could truly and honestly say she understands But at least now she might not complain so much when I can t go out for dinner some nights or when I never seem to make it to her house and she always has to drive to mine I gave her a hug when we walked out of the diner I had the one spoon in my hand and I said Don t worry I see this as a blessing I have been forced to think about everything I do Do you know how many spoons people waste everyday I don t have room for wasted time or wasted spoons and I chose to spend this time with you Ever since this night I have used the spoon theory to explain my life to many people In fact my family and friends refer to spoons all the time It has been a code word for what I can and cannot do Once people understand the spoon theory they seem to understand me better but I also think they live their life a little differently too I think it isn t just good for understanding Lupus but anyone dealing with any disability or illness Hopefully they don t take so much for granted or their life in general I give a piece of myself in every sense of the word when I do anything It has become an inside joke I have become famous for saying to people jokingly that they should feel special when I spend time with them because they have one of my spoons 2003 by Christine Miserandino

"",""body"":""Vegetarian chili with all the fixins Vegetarian chili is one of the first veggie entrees that pop into people s minds along with vegetarian lasagna of course It is a delicious easy and very nutritious meal in a bowl Add some tortillas or brown butter cornbread and a salad and you ll feel like a king It also can be made ahead it just gets better over the course of a couple of days and it freezes well There are many types of vegetarian chili some loaded up with a meat substitute like TVP or vegetarian ground beef or even bulghar wheat and others full of vegetables I m not a fan I like to highlight the beans cooking two or three varieties with a simple and flavorful tomato chili sauce and just a few aromatic vegetables to build the flavor base Multiple choice garnishes give each diner the opportunity to customize to their own palate This is my weekend version of the vegetarian chili recipe where I boil my own beans and make a tomato chili sauce from relative scratch Sometime soon I ll post a weeknight formula using more prepared ingredients But remember you can make this on the weekend and eat it all week Let s talk about heat level for a minute This sauce is flavored primarily with whole dried chili peppers You can control the spice by how many you put in and how hot they are I like to build a moderately spicy base and then add canned chipotle pepper to the nearly finished product as needed Don t omit them completely even if you don t like much heat because they provide a lot of fruity flavor and thicken the sauce Just go for milder varieties like ancho Aim for the lowest common denominator that your dining companions can handle and then offer hot sauces on the side like Tapatio or Tabasco or more adventurous brews Don t try to use fresh chilis they are for completely different types of dishes I use a mixture of pinto black and kidney beans in this recipe and soak them overnight You can get away without soaking them or do a quick soak for a couple of hours starting with hot water But honestly it isn t the same Overnight soaked beans just plain come out more tender and delicious and much better than from a can Vegetarian Chili From ScratchYields around 10 cups easily serving 5 and doubles or triples beautifully Vegetarian gluten free and vegan if you modify the garnishes Prep time 20 minutes Cook time 2 hours 1 5 cups dry pinto beans 1 cup dry black beans 1 2 cup dry kidney beans 3 to 6 dried chili pods any combination of ancho guajillo pasilla cascabel de arbol see above 1 small can chipotle pepper in adobo 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes 1 medium carrot finely diced 1 white or yellow onion finely diced 2 stalks celery finely diced 1 4 cup canola or other neutral vegetable oil 4 cloves garlic minced juice of 1 2 lemon salt For garnish green onion sliced thin mostly white parts only or white onion minced cilantro leaves grated cheddar or queso anejo or cotija sour cream or queso fresco lime wedges Carefully sort through the beans removing any extraneous material Rinse well Put in the pot you will eventually cook in add 2 quarts of water and soak overnight The next day drain the beans add water to cover by an inch or so and bring to a boil Reduce to a simmer and cook until the beans are very tender which could take 1 to 2 hours depending on their age Add water occasionally and stir to prevent any scorching When nearly done add 2 teaspoons of salt Meanwhile toast the chilis in a hot dry skillet until darkened on both sides Ventilate the room well while you do this it produces a rather intense smoke that some people find painful Allow to cool Hint use dispoable gloves for this step to avoid having spicy hands Break apart the chilis and dispose of the seeds and stems Add the chilis tomato sauce half of the adobo sauce from the can of chipotle and 1 teaspoon of salt to a blender and puree until very smooth This sauce should be pretty spicy because it is going in that huge pot of beans soon Saute the carrot onion and celery with 1 teaspoon of salt in the oil for about 10 minutes until soft Add the garlic and saute for 1 more minute Drain most of the liquid from the beans reserving a cup for later dilution if needed Add the chili sauce vegetables and lemon juice to the beans Bring back to a simmer and let cook for 10 minutes or so allowing the flavors to begin to marry Now taste If it needs more heat or a smoke add the rest of the adobo sauce If it needs a lot more heat you can puree the chipotle peppers and add them Add salt as needed You shouldn t be tasting a lemon flavor but there should be a subtle hint of acidity that wakes up the sauce If the whole thing is too thick you can dilute it with some of the reserved bean cooking liquid Serve your vegetarian chili forth with the garnishes listed above vegan, gluten-free, chili, mexican, tex-mex, healthy, vegetarian, veggie, veg, recipe, recipes, cooking, eating, dining, blog, restaurants, organic, cookbooks vegetarian chili with all the fixins' vegetarian chili is one of the first veggie entrees that pop into people's minds (along with vegetarian lasagna of course). it is a delicious, easy and very

champion league messi 1st player with 5 goals in champion league"",""body"":""BARCELONA Spain For all the astonishing feats in his young career Lionel Messi had never scored five goals in a professional game And no one had ever scored five times in a Champions League match Well check both of those off With another mesmerizing performance Messi helped defending champion Barcelona crush Bayer Leverkusen 7 1 Wednesday night to advance to the quarterfinals with a 10 2 aggregate win Without Messi Barca is the best team Leverkusen coach Robin Dutt said And with him they are in another galaxy The three time FIFA player of the year scored in the 25th 42nd and 49th minutes for a 3 0 lead and his 17th career hat trick for Barcelona then added goals in the 58th and 84th minutes for the first five goal game of his professional career We ll never see a player like him again Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola said He is one of a kind The last time a player scored five goals in European soccer s top club competition had been when Ajax s Soren Lerby did it against Omonia in the old Champion Clubs Cup in 1979 80 Messi is a joke For me the best ever Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney wrote on Twitter Messi scored his first goal when Xavi Hernandez s long pass sent him in alone he took a touch and chipped goalkeeper Bernd Leno with his left foot from 12 yards On the second he cut across from the right after a pass from Andres Iniesta and sent a left footed shot in from 14 yards through a crowd of defenders He scored the third with a chip from 9 yards off his weaker right foot Cesc Fabregas made a pass from just past midfield and Messi held off defender Daniel Schwaab as he took three touches He became the first player to score four goals twice in the Champions League he accomplished the feat against Arsenal two years ago when Leno batted a ball knocked toward the goal by a defender right to Messi who poked the ball in with his left foot from an angle Messi s fifth was on a curling left footed shot from 19 yards He has 48 goals for Barcelona this season including 12 in the Champions League He increased his Champions League career total to 49 tying Alfredo Di Stefano for fourth on the European Cup Champions League career list I can t remember the last time I scored five goals so I m very happy Messi said It s nice to score five goals Just 24 years old he has 228 goals for Barcelona and is seven from tying Cesar Rodriguez for the club s career scoring record Messi has seven hat tricks this season He s the best There is no other like him Guardiola said The numbers speak for themselves One day he ll score six We re very fortunate to have Messi so we have to take advantage of him Substitute Cristian Tello added a pair of goals for Barcelona which extended its home unbeaten streak to 50 games Leverkusen became the first German club since 1964 to lose an aggregate series by nine goals What was important was to win Messi said That s what we wanted to achieve now we re in the quarterfinals and we did it impressively In the night s other game Cyprus APOEL Nicosia beat Lyon 4 3 on penalty kicks following a 1 0 win that left the aggregate and away goals both tied in the series Gustavo Manduca scored in the ninth minute and goalkeeper Dionisios Chiotis saved kicks from Alexandre Lacazette and Michel Bastos in the shootout APOEL is the first Cypriot club to advance to the quarterfinals Jermain Defoe took advantage of a rare start to score twice in a 3 1 victory over third tier Stevenage that advanced Tottenham to the FA Cup quarterfinals Joel Byrom s penalty kick put the visitors ahead in the fourth minute of the fifth round replay but Defoe tied it in the 26th with a left footed shot from outside the penalty area Emmanuel Adebayor converted a penalty kick to put Spurs ahead in the 54th and Defoe got his second goal in the 75th Tottenham defender Michael Dawson was carried off on a stretcher early on with suspected ruptured ankle ligaments while winger Aaron Lennon limped off later in the first half Tottenham hosts Bolton in an all Premier League quarterfinal on March 17 as Spurs seek its first FA Cup title since 1991 Juventus was held to a costly 1 1 draw at Bologna giving AC Milan the advantage in the race for the Serie A title Bologna s 35 year old captain Marco Di Vaio put the hosts ahead in the 17th minute In a match postponed last month by a snowstorm Mirko Vucinic tied it in the 58th for Juve which has one win in its last six games Defending champion AC Milan 16 4 6 holds a two point

"http://www.thedailyspud.com/2011/03/06/potato-cups-smoked-salmon/"	"4955"	"{""title"":""Potato Cups With Smoked Salmon "",""body"":""Spud Sunday My Cups Runneth Over Give me an Irish theme to cook to and yes chances are I ll give you spuds There s also a fair chance me being me that they won t necessarily be the kind of spuds you re used to That I think it s safe to say is something you ve come to expect around here Take these potato cups individual shells made from thinly sliced potato and used to serve well anything Potato cups with smoked salmon To be honest I m not entirely sure how the idea for these potato cups emerged but emerge it did when faced with the prospect of making something for last Friday s cookalong with the Irish Foodies group The group invites any willing participants to make or bake something on a given evening each month and with a given theme Last Friday s theme was traditional Irish and while the spuds might be in a somewhat non traditional form they are undeniably an emblem of traditional Irish eating Fill them with smoked salmon or other suitably Irish fillings and you ve got yourself some individually sized tastes of Ireland Needless to remark these would be perfect fodder for the Paddy s Day Food Parade which is open to anyone who d care to concoct a dish with our national holiday in mind I d love to have your entries Potato Cups If there is such a thing as beginner s luck then that is what I had with my first batch of these I went from idea namely to line muffin tins with thinly sliced potato in order to create mini potato shells or cups to successful execution in fairly short order My second batch however stuck to the tin like crazy so while these are very easy to make there is a bit of devil in the detail Once you get the hang of these you ll find endless uses for them especially in the canap\u00e9s and starters department I filled mine with smoked salmon but any number of fillings are possible They can be made a few hours ahead of time if you like and I also tried freezing some which seem to work ok If you do freeze them defrost fully before use and give them a minute or two in a low oven to crisp up You ll need About 300g potato 1 large or 2 smallish potatoes use a dry floury variety 2 tsp vegetable oil or clarified butter a good pinch of salt You ll also need A mandoline or other implement to cut very fine potato slices and a 12 piece muffin tin I d also recommend some parchment paper to line the muffin tins The Steps Preheat your oven to 180C Scrub your potatoes very well and using a mandoline or similar slice the unpeeled potatoes very finely about 1mm thick Pat the potato slices dry on pieces of kitchen paper then toss them in the oil or clarified butter and salt If using parchment paper to line your muffin tins and I would recommend you do so cut out squares that will be large enough to sit into each individual tin otherwise use a non stick tin if you have one or at the very least grease your tins very well To prepare each cup press a square of parchment paper if using down into the muffin mould it won t sit perfectly but don t worry about that it ll sit better once you add the potatoes If you like you can make cuts in the parchment paper from each corner towards but not all the way through to the centre which should help it to sit a bit better Line the sides and base of each mould with potato slices such that each slice overlaps with at least half of the previously placed slice and so that you end up with a thickness of about 2 slices all round see also header notes above Bake until the potato cups are mostly a golden brown colour this took about 17 20 minutes for me but ovens vary so start checking after about 15 minutes as these can burn easily If you ve used parchment paper the cups can be removed straightaway and allowed to cool otherwise allow them to cool a little in the tin before easing them out gently using a knife They are amenable to any number of fillings The Variations The variations here really come down to what you use to fill the cups In this you are limited only by your imagination The Results Makes about 12 potato cups Potato Cups With Smoked Salmon And Cream Cheese You ll need 300g smoked salmon roughly chopped 150g cream cheese 3 tblsp chopped dill or to taste 3 tblsp chopped flat leaf parsley or to taste 1 tblsp capers drained lemon juice to taste freshly ground black pepper 12 potato cups as per recipe above The Steps Mix together the smoked salmon cream cheese dill parsley capers lemon juice and black pepper and adjust seasonings to taste Once you re happy with it use the mixture to fill the potato cups and serve The Variations You can skip the cream cheese if you like and just serve slices of smoked salmon in the potato cups sprinkled with lemon juice dill and parsley The Results 12 salmon filled potato cups individual potato cups: shells of thinly sliced potato which make an excellent vessel for lots of things. a mix of irish smoked salmon and cream cheese is just one of the possibilities. gluten-free, potato recipes, spud sundays, canapes, cream cheese, potatoes, smoked

Twitter I have to admit that I have my ups and downs with the exercise habit So I know that it s not the easiest habit for most people and most people s experiences consist of starting and stopping and starting again Which is fine don t beat yourself up about it The important thing is starting again I ve written before about how to build the exercise habit and even have a guest post on it but today I thought I d revisit the topic for those who still have trouble The Main ProblemsSo why do most people have trouble making exercise a regular habit Well there are probably a number of factors but here are the main ones as I see it Too difficult People set out with a lot of ambition and enthusiasm and start out with a big goal I m going to go to the gym for an hour a day or I m going to run 30 minutes every day The problem is that the goal is too difficult to sustain for very long You can do it for a few days but you soon run out of energy and it becomes a drag to do it Too many goals Often we set out to do too much We want to run and lift weights and eat healthy and quit sweets and stop drinking soda Well those are multiple goals and you cannot focus on the exercise habit if you re trying to do all the others at the same time Or we might start with one goal but then get caught up in another goal to stop procrastinating for example and lose our focus on the first one Not enough motivation It s not a lack of discipline it s a lack of motivation The most powerful motivators in my experience are logging your habit and public pressure There are many others that help as well The 4 Simple StepsSo how do we solve those problems Keep it simple Here are the 4 simple steps to start the exercise habit and keep it going I should note that you can use these 4 steps to start any habit Set one easy specific measurable goal There are several keys to setting this crucial goal Written Write this down Post it up If you don t write it down it s not important Easy Don t DO NOT set a difficult goal Set one that is super super easy Five minutes of exercise a day You can do that Work your way to 10 minutes after a month Then go to 15 after 2 months You can see what I mean make it easy to start with so you can build your habit then gradually increase Specific By specific I mean what activity are you going to do at what time of day and where Don t just say exercise or I m going to walk You have to set a time and place Make it an appointment you can t miss Trigger I recommend that you have a trigger right before you do your habit For example you might always brush your teeth right after you shower The shower is the trigger for brushing your teeth and because of that you never forget to brush your teeth Well what will you do right before you exercise Is it right after you wake up Right after your coffee Right when you get home As soon as you take off for lunch A trigger that you do every single day is important Measurable By measurable I mean that you should be able to say definitely whether you hit or miss your goal today Examples run for 10 minutes Walk 1 2 a mile Do 3 sets of 5 pushups Each of those has a number that you can shoot for One goal Stick to this one goal for at least a month Two months if you can bear it Don t start up a second goal during that 30 day period If you do you are scrapping this goal Log it daily This is the key habit If you can log your workout you will start to see your progress and it will motivate you to keep going And you have to make it a habit to log it right away Don t put it off and say you ll do it before you go to bed As soon as you re done working out log it No exceptions And don t make the log complicated that will only make you resist doing the log Just the date time and what you did Report to others I think this is key You can do it on your blog on an online forum with your spouse or friends or family or a workout partner or a coach or a group or a class However you set it up make it part of the process that you have to report your daily workout to other people It could be using an online log or on a forum or through email or the phone or just by telling your co workers what you did this morning But be sure that they know your goal and that you are going to report to them and be sure that they are expecting it every day Add motivation as needed The first three steps might be enough for you to get the habit going But if not don t just give up If you miss two consecutive workouts you need to look at why and add a new motivation Rewards more public pressure inspiration whatever it takes Read this article for more on this You can add one additional motivator and then see if it works If you miss two more consecutive workouts at any time add another motivator And so on until the exercise habit sticks If you liked this article please bookmark it on del icio us or vote for it on Digg I d appreciate it Also see "",""url"":""zenhabits 2007 09 4 simple steps to start the exercise

jams If you re already listening to tunes try something a little faster The ideal beats per minute range is between 120 and 140 BPM Search online for other people s favorite workout songs or run your own music through a BPM calculator to find the best fast paced tunes Set goals Having both short term and long term fitness goals in mind can help keep you motivated every time you work out Weight and size goals are great for consistent inspiration but weekly and daily goals can keep you going when you re taking it minute by minute in a grueling workout For example if you ve decided that you ll work out four times a week you won t want to cut a workout short because you ll have to make it up another day Or say you re running on a treadmill set an attainable distance or time goal By the time you reach it you might feel like you can go on for another quarter mile or five minutes and you can keep moving your goal in small increments making you feel great every time you reach your newest goal Take a class You know that unpleasant little thing known as peer pressure Well it can work wonders for your workout motivation If you take a fitness class whether it s Zumba yoga spinning or something else you re going to feel the pressure to stick it out Beyond not wanting to feel like a quitter in front of a room full of people you re probably also paying for this class either per class or as part of your gym membership and money can be a great motivator Get your money s worth by finishing the class even if you need to take it at your own pace Find a workout buddy Just like a class a workout partner can provide a certain amount of peer pressure but they can also be a great encouragement When you re not feeling motivated they can help remind you why you re doing this Plus who s going to spot them on weights or keep them moving if you quit Bring your friend along for inspiration competition and even just a companion to keep your mind off of all the hard work you re doing Do something you enjoy You won t be counting down the agonizing minutes if you re busy having fun Finding an exercise you actually enjoy is the best way to sustain an active lifestyle You won t dread workouts and they ll be over before you know it Figure out whether you enjoy team sports swimming dancing or something else entirely and then do it Motivation won t be an issue Mix it up Even exercises that you like can get old and boring if you do them every day For the sake of your sanity and your motivation you ve got to mix up your workout routine If you re in the middle of your workout and you feel like quitting consider moving on to a different activity Switch between different types of cardio or vary when you do cardio weights yoga and sports You ll feel mentally refreshed whenever you switch to a different activity Buy new workout gear Of course one of the main reasons you re working out is so you can look good and feel good but looking good while working out can actually make you feel good If you ve found that your will power has been waning in the middle of a workout try a few new workout outfits New pants shorts tops and shoes can give your self esteem a boost that can actually make you feel better about pushing forward with a workout You look awesome so why wouldn t you want to show it off Have a reward in mind It s amazing what rewards can do for our motivation Just knowing that you ll earn something tangible if you keep going can be enough to get you through another half hour of biking lifting weights or jogging Choose something you ll enjoy but not something that will cancel out the workout you just did so hands off the Twinkies Some suggestions a few new workout songs new clothes a nap a bubble bath anything that will keep your body moving until the end of the workout Post navigation Recent Life Insurance Articles View All Articles October 8 2012 8 Ways to Stay Motivated During a Workout October 7 2012 8 Great Exercises You Can

Marques and Sophie Sassard LONDON Mon Sep 10 2012 3 55pm BST LONDON Reuters Commodities trader Glencore laid out what it said was a final 36 billion 22 5 billion pounds takeover offer for Xstrata on Monday warning the miner s investors it would not improve the terms again after making concessions to woo recalcitrant shareholders Glencore which already owns just over a third of Xstrata confirmed its bid was now at 3 05 new shares for every Xstrata share held This is up from 2 8 and in line with proposals made on Friday following an unexpected turnaround that ended months of stalemate with the miner s second largest investor Qatar That level represents a 27 percent premium to the ratio at which Glencore and Xstrata were trading last week when the market believed the deal would collapse Glencore confirms that it is an all share merger and it will not increase the merger ratio further the trading company said The increased merger ratio represents a substantial premium for a company with a 34 percent shareholder The offer released after a weekend of intense negotiations has been seen by those close to the deal as more conciliatory and less aggressive than proposals presented to Xstrata s board on Friday just minutes before the miner s shareholders were due to vote on Glencore s original bid Glencore s chief executive and top shareholder Ivan Glasenberg still demands the top job in the combined entity but the deal now retains a merger structure unless a change is approved by Xstrata rather than shifting to a straightforward takeover requiring a simple majority to approve the bid It also provides for a balanced board as in the original bid made in February and makes the deal conditional on a retention scheme for the miner s senior managers easing concerns about the operational risk of changes at the top Shares in Xstrata were up 2 4 percent at 1 038 5 pence at 12 20 p m British time outperforming a 1 8 percent rise in the UK mining sector while Glencore was down 1 2 percent At those levels the shares are trading around a higher ratio of 2 8 which would indicate the market is assigning a greater possibility that the deal will happen Qatar which demanded in June a ratio of 3 25 to approve the deal was considering its position on Monday after what one source familiar with the deal described as Glencore s curveball last week Several sources had said Qatar was surprised by some of Glencore s provisions in Friday s proposal including the departure of Xstrata Chief Executive Mick Davis who has been implicitly backed by Qatar so far Neither Davis going nor the 3 05 were what the Qataris had in mind when they put their heads above the parapet in June the source asked This is taking some thinking Xstrata for its part said its independent directors were considering the fresh bid and would respond by 7 00 a m on September 24 after consulting with major shareholders At least one source involved in the deal said a response could come before then The interesting dilemma is going to be that the Xstrata board having supported the offer at 2 8 and now being presented with an offer at 3 05 is going to find it pretty hard to refuse it said John Robinson chairman of Global Mining Investments a fund managed by BlackRock Glencore s biggest investment management shareholder It now comes down to personalities One of Xstrata s 40 largest investors added The deal looks much more likely to happen now I d be surprised if the independent Xstrata directors say no GLASENBERG AT THE TOPIn line with proposals on Friday Glencore s Glasenberg would take the top job at the expense of Xstrata boss Davis a mining industry veteran who would have taken the chief executive role under the original offer Davis already one of the best paid chief executives of the FTSE 100 was left bruised by a package to keep him in his job that was deemed too generous and by Xstrata s decision to back a deal many investors disowned Glasenberg said by one source close to the deal to have pounced on the opportunity to oust his long time rival will take over after an interim period of six months Davis has held the top job at Xstrata for a decade building it up from a 500 million collection of zinc and ferrochrome assets into the world s fourth largest diversified miner Xstrata is on the cusp of a period of production growth as it moves from older more expensive mines to newer more efficient projects boosting volumes by 50 percent by 2014 The thing Davis was brought in to do he s done He s a dealmaker He s not an operator said one of Xstrata s top 30 shareholders Xstrata s operators who bring these things in on time and in the money compared to most other people they re the brilliant guys and they re staying In a gesture to appease both the independent directors and shareholders fretting over management of these projects Glencore said it would keep a retention scheme for top managers Glencore however signalled it could change a package seen by some investors as too generous One source said that could involve setting tougher performance targets Xstrata Chairman John Bond will keep the job in the combined group as under the original proposals and the board will be drawn evenly from the two companies A former chairman of Vodafone and HSBC Bond is considered a steadier hand than Glencore chairman Simon Murray but has also been criticised by some minority shareholders for recommending the initial Glencore offer Glencore made a long awaited takeover bid for Xstrata in February But the offer ran into trouble and had been expected to fail as shareholders prepared to vote last Friday with Qatar and other investors opposed the terms of the deal The impasse was resolved in late night talks at a London hotel facilitated by former British prime minister Tony Blair Additional reporting by Sonali Paul in Melbourn Raji Menon in London Editing by Will Waterman and David Stamp london (reuters) - commodities trader glencore

But with an estimated 2 2 million Indians still suffereing from AIDS the battle is yet to be won Awareness about the epidemic and how to contain it by use of condoms has in a way played a significant role in tackling the disease In order to spread this awareness further on the occasion of World s AIDS Day we present 10 tips for using a condom Note Our intent here is to provide good and clean content on sexual health We want to resolve all the mis conceptions and curiosities about this subject If you feel uncomfortable because of any article in this section please let us know Using a condom is the best way through which you can prevent pregnancy or contracting transmitting sexually transmitted diseases It s absolutely imperative if you have a tendency to enjoy sex with multiple sexual partners simultaneously Condoms have been shown to be 98 effective when used in the right way Here are some basic principles that need to be kept in mind while using a condom to ensure that you get the best possible protection for yourself and your partner 1 Check the quality certificate Always try to look for the quality certificate of the condom on the packaging before buying it If it carries the CE mark then you can be assured of its quality LifeMojo is one of the most trusted source of information about good health and wellness To those who want to manage their health themselves LifeMojo provides necessary information tips tracking tools and support to help them stay informed and motivated Photographs Lifemojo com Last updated on December 1 2011 12 42 IST 2 Check the expiry

between the penis and the vagina or the anus to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases or other viruses Photographs Uttam Ghosh Rediff com Last updated on December 1 2011 12 42 IST 5 Use them after erection Donning the condom after getting a full erection will give you better protection than wearing it on a flaccid penis Photographs Bryan Brenneman of Sheridan OR USA Last updated on December 1 2011 12 42 IST 6 Use a condom every time Using a condom every single time during sex is the sign of a responsible adult Even one encounter without a condom can result in STDs sexually transmitted diseases and or pregnancy Photographs Rediff Archives Last updated on December 1 2011 12 42 IST 7 Change condoms regularly If you re having a long session with your partner ensure that you change your condom for a new one every thirty minutes as otherwise the chances of breakage will increase multifold leaving you exposed to the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases not to mention an unwanted pregnancy You can also change your condom after ejaculation if you re up for another round Last updated on December 1 2011 12 42 IST 8 Avoid multiple condoms Using two condoms simultaneously increases the chance of them rubbing together and causing friction to develop thereby leading to breakage and failure This is true even in the case of both male condoms or one male and one female condom Read How to use a femal condom Last updated on December 1 2011 12 42 IST 9 Store and dispose well As condoms are made from latex they are sensitive to heat and light so store them in a cool and dark place If you live in a hot and humid place it is better to store them in the refrigerator especially in the summer months Always wrap the used condom in its foil packaging and dispose it off by throwing it in the trash Do not flush a used condom Last updated on December 1 2011 12 42 IST 10 Using a lubricant Do not use oil based products like moisturisers creams and body oils to lubricate the vagina or the anus while using a latex condom These oil based products can weaken the condom leading to easy breakage and leakage This would defeat the entire purpose of using a condom Instead use water based lubricants that are readily available at most chemists shops If you are careful and use a condom properly every time you have sex then you can enjoy a healthy and long sexual life with minimal risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases However a condom does not absolve you from the responsibility of finding out about your potential partner s sexual past and the number and type of people s he has been with to assess the risks you will be taking with your own health in case of condom breakage or failure Also read How to use the female condom How to wear a male condom 10 tips to avoid sexually transmitted diseases Eight tips of practising safer sex DON T believe these sexual health myths Using a condom is necessary even in the case

symptoms"",""body"":""Every day your body tells you all kinds of things Scratch my elbow I d like some salt But hidden in these signals can be deeper messages about your health Here s how to decode them What You Can Learn From the Whites of Your Eyes If they look grayish It s probably just a result of the natural aging process which can make the whites of your eyes formally known as sclerae become grayer The sclera thins over time so the deep vascular tissue underneath shows through says Christopher Coad an ophthalmologist at Chelsea Eye Associates in New York City That said there are some serious medical conditions that can turn your whites gray including rheumatoid arthritis and brittle bone syndrome As a starting point schedule an exam with your ophthalmologist who may refer you to a specialist If they look red Most likely your eyes are dry Those red squiggles you see are tiny blood vessels which become more prominent when eyes are irritated Dryness can be a result of age staring at the computer or environmental factors like air conditioning says Coad Preservative free artificial tears sold at drugstores help lubricate eyes with ingredients like glycerin and can soothe irritation use four to six times daily as needed If the dryness worsens see your ophthalmologist as dry eyes can be a symptom of conditions like thyroid disease and diabetes says Coad If you also have itching and tearing allergies may be to blame try an over the counter antihistamine If they look yellow It may be jaundice which is caused by a high level of bilirubin a by product of red blood cells See a doctor right away as jaundice can be a sign of several serious health problems including liver dysfunction hepatitis and in rare cases pancreatic cancer What You Can Learn From Your Sleep Habits If you fall asleep as soon as your head hits the pillow Surprise surprise you re probably sleep deprived says Dr James Herdegen the medical director of the Sleep Science Center at the University of Illinois at Chicago It takes a well rested person about 10 to 15 minutes to fall asleep Ideally aim for eight hours or so a night If you already get that much see your doctor to rule out sleep onset conditions such as restless legs syndrome If you wake up a lot at night You may have sleep maintenance insomnia in which the difficulty isn t falling asleep but staying asleep The disorder has been linked to anxiety depression and sleep apnea If you toss and turn or experience daytime sleepiness for more than four weeks see your doctor who may refer you to a sleep specialist What You Can Learn From Your Cravings If you crave salt You may need some stress relief Your constant search for a salt fix could signal that your adrenal glands which pump adrenaline and other hormones into your blood when you re feeling anxious have been working so hard that they re temporarily exhausted The adrenal glands produce a hormone that holds sodium in your body so if they re not making enough of that hormone you may crave salt says Dr Susan Blum the founder and director of the Blum Center for Health in Rye Brook N Y To keep stress in check try exercise meditation or just saying no to yet another PTA request If you crave fat It s well known that eating sweets and simple carbohydrates can lead to the infamous sugar crash that leaves you craving more Consuming fat has a similar self perpetuating effect says Sarah Leibowitz an associate professor of neurobiology at Rockefeller University in New York City Eating fatty foods stimulates the brain to produce peptides that make you crave more fat she says A recent study at the Scripps Research Institute in Jupiter Fla showed that rats who were fed high fat foods bacon icing began eating more and more a hallmark of addictive behavior They actually refused nutritious food when it was offered Fight the urge for chips by eating plenty of lean protein and low fat dairy products which will help you feel more satisfied More From Real Simple Weird Symptoms Explained17 Ways to Safeguard Your Heart8 Health Shortcuts That Work What You Can Learn From Your Hair If your hairline is receding If you have a family history of thinning you might be experiencing female pattern hair loss androgenetic alopecia which occurs in 30 to 40 percent of women A dermatologist can prescribe medication or a topical treatment to help It s also worth noting that your ponytail may be too tight tearing strands from the hairline and creating a condition called traction alopecia If your part seems wider than usual Your body could be under stress But be aware Losing a handful of hairs a day or about 100 strands is normal A significant physical event such as surgery childbirth or even a dramatic weight loss can cause hair follicles to shift into a resting state and temporarily stop growing Stay calm Once you fully recover your hair will gradually return What You Can Learn From Your Mouth If your gums are swollen or bleed You may have periodontal disease says Greg Diamond a periodontist in New York City About 75 percent of people over the age of 40 do Most people think nothing of it if they spit blood after flossing says Diamond but your gums should never bleed And though periodontal disease may not be painful the bacteria that create it have been linked with systemic problems like strokes and heart disease So keep up with your professional cleanings twice yearly flossing daily and brushing ideally after every meal If you have whitish or reddish dots on the back of your tongue Have your primary care physician or dentist test you for the human papilloma virus HPV which is on the rise HPV is tricky to detect and typically goes away on its own but in some cases it can lead to cancer of the mouth throat or cervix So if you do have the virus you ll need to be monitored going forward If your tongue is smooth and shiny and you can t see your taste buds You may be lacking in vitamin B12 says Dr Jacob Teitelbaum the Kona Hawaii based author of Beat Sugar Addiction Now Cracks at the corners of your mouth may also signal a B vitamin deficiency says Minka Schofield an otolaryngologist at Ohio State University Medical Center in Columbus What You Can Learn From Your Skin If it suddenly turns dry and itchy It could be a reaction to a new skin care product If you can rule that out have your thyroid and iron levels checked Dry skin can signal low thyroid levels or anemia says Ava Shamban a dermatologist in Beverly Hills and the author of Heal Your Skin Your primary care physician or dermatologist can run simple blood tests and refer you to a specialist if necessary If you break out on your jawline Your hormones may be in overdrive Acne in this area is common for women in their 30s and 40s even those who have always had clear skin especially right before their periods Treat it with a traditional over the counter cream containing salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide If that doesn t work have your hormone levels checked by your ob gyn says Elizabeth Hale a clinical associate professor of dermatology at the New York University Medical Center in New York City Often hormonal acne can be improved with medications such as oral contraceptives If you have a rash that won t go away It might be mild eczema which can show up as a result of stress To soothe the itch apply a lotion containing ceramides several times daily or see your dermatologist for a prescription strength nonsteroidal calming cream Another option Slather on olive oil says Shamban It adds essential fats to the skin and has anti inflammatory properties that can help with eczema What You Can Learn From Your Urine If it s pale yellow or clear You re well hydrated It shows that you re drinking enough water to dilute your urine which is naturally yellow says Blum If it s dark yellow Start doubling your water intake downing herbal tea and eating a few servings of water rich fruit like cantaloupe daily If you ve taken a multivitamin in the last 24 hours bright yellow urine sometimes means your body is doing a good job of absorbing it When you take a multivitamin your body uses what it needs and excretes the rest so if you see neon urine the vitamin has successfully passed through your system says Blum If your urine is very pale after taking a multivitamin you might not be absorbing it properly she says In that case switch to a quick absorbing vitamin capsule or powder They re easier for the body to break down than tablets If it s cloudy You could have a bladder or kidney infection Cloudiness indicates the presence of white blood cells which your body sends to fight off infection says Blum See your ob gyn or primary care physician for a proper diagnosis If you see blood or it s very dark in color If you had any doubts we ll state it for the record See your doctor that is unless you are menstruating Blood and darkness could be signs of various illnesses from bladder infections to kidney disease says Blum What You Can Learn From Your Feet If your heels or arches hurt when you walk You may have flatfeet which means your arches collapse more than they should when you put weight on them Flatfeet can lead to knee and lower back pain says podiatrist James Christina the director of scientific affairs for the American Podiatric Medical Association Try over the counter arch support inserts and if the pain persists see a podiatrist If they cramp up when you walk This could be a sign of peripheral artery disease in which blood doesn t effectively circulate to the extremities Poor circulation can lead to lactic acid buildup in the foot muscles which causes cramps says Christina See a podiatrist right away for an initial diagnosis what breakouts, cravings, and other minor bodily complaints may mean what breakouts,

of an influence my childhood has had on my favourite flavours I grew up eating light sponges and regular yellow birthday cakes and I ve never had the least bit of interest in dense mud cakes I had a mug of hot milo before bed on most evenings and that obsession has never gone away Grape flavoured bubble tape and Grape Fanta has ensured my attachment to fake grape flavoured treats And the strip of strawberry in a tub of neapolitan ice cream has locked in my intense love for all things strawberry milk flavoured It may be artificial tasting to some people and it does tend to make me feel a little ill because I always have too much but strawberry ice cream strawberry flavoured milk and I m a little ashamed to admit it Macca s strawberry thickshakes are my weakness I can never resist it but I always regret it later Suze was telling me about the strawberry milk macarons from Cafe Cre Asion that sounded amazing and I really wanted to try With the combination of my strawberry flavoured milk weakness and Suze s encouraging Dooooo it s I had to test it out for myself I decided to combine it with another idea that I had for a cookie dough buttercream It seemed kind of appropriate I ve mentioned on this blog before that I have a serious weakness for choc chip cookies They are the one thing besides scones that I will whip up randomly just so I can be a total pig and I can never stop at one So this macaron flavour was full of all the things I was addicted to I thought about flavouring the macaron shells with Strawberry Nesquik to give it the strawberry milk flavour and some quick searching on the internet proved to me that it should work well see What The Fruitcake I also found a cookie dough buttercream from Annie Eat s which looked amazing and I had to try Oh my god THIS BUTTERCREAM IS ON ANOTHER LEVEL It is so good I insist that you try it immediately put it on a cupcake or just sit there are eat it straight out of the mixing bowl with a wooden spoon like I did And it has the added bonus of not having any raw egg in it It really tastes just like cookie dough I also used slightly salted butter to give it a little extra kick and mixed in small dark chocolate chip bits in the hope that it would help offset the super sweetness from the strawberry nesquik in the macaron shells I was actually surprised by how intense the flavour of strawberry came through in the macarons It was almost too strong it kind of overpowered the flavour of the cookie dough buttercream I m glad that I made sure to fill the macarons with a very thick layer of buttercream it really needed it and it tasted so good I ve also adjusted the amount of strawberry nesquik in the macarons because I think I used a little too much in my original recipe I d even consider adding even more salt to the buttercream because it still seemed a tad too sweet for my liking But you really can taste that strawberry milk flavour in these macarons It might not be everyone s favourite flavour but it s one of mine and I can t say no to it Strawberry Milk Macarons with Cookie Dough Buttercream buttercream recipe adapted from Annie Eats 100g aged egg whites you can use fresh eggs too just make sure they are room temperature I always use fresh these days and zap it in the microwave on defrost for 10 seconds 110g almond meal at room temperature and well sifted150g icing sugar50g Strawberry Nesquik50g caster sugarOptional 1 tsp powdered egg whites available from The Essential Ingredient helps to stabilise egg whites but is not necessaryFor the buttercream 115g 1 stick butter at room temperature I used slightly salted butter 1 4 cup light brown sugar packed1 cup sifted icing sugar1 3 cup all purpose flour1 4 tsp salt1 tbsp milk1 2 pure vanilla extract1 2 cup mini dark chocolate chips or very finely chopped dark chocolate I pulsed mine through the food processor to break it up Prepare the macarons Line two baking sheets with baking paper Place icing sugar and strawberry nesquik in food processor and pulse for a minute to remove any lumps Stir in almond meal and pulse for about 30 seconds to combine Place in a large mixing bowl and set aside Using an electric mixer beat egg whites and egg white powder in a medium mixing bowl until the egg white powder dissolves and it reaches soft peaks With the mixer on high speed gradually add sugar and then add food colouring and beat until it reaches stiff peaks Add meringue and to your dry mixture and mix quickly at first to break down the bubbles in the egg white you really want to beat all the large bubbles out of the mixture be rough then mix carefully as the dry mixture becomes incorporated and it starts to become shiny again Take care not to overmix the mixture should flow like lava and a streak of mixture spread over the surface of the rest of the mixture should disappear after about 30 seconds Place in a piping bag and pipe rounds of about 3 5cm diameter on baking sheets Leave to dry for about half an hour to an hour so that when you press the surface of one gently it does not break This will help prevent any cracking and help the feet to form on the macs Preheat your oven to 140 150 C 285 300 C depending on your oven Place on top of an overturned roasting tray or another baking sheet if your sheets are not professional grade for better heat distribution Bake for 15 20 minutes depending on the size of your shells Carefully test if the base of the shell is ready by gently lifting one and if it s still soft and sticking to the baking paper then it needs to bake for a few minutes longer Remove from the oven and cool on the tray for a few minutes then gently remove from the sheet and place on a wire rack to cool completely Prepare the icing beat together the butter and brown sugar a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer on high until creamy With the mixer on low gradually add sifted icing sugar then increase speed and beat until combined Beat in the flour and salt on low until just combined With the mixer still on low beat in the milk and vanilla extract until smooth and well blended Fold in mini chocolate chips until evenly distributed Sandwich macaron shells with a generous amount of buttercream I used about a tablespoon or so for each Refrigerate overnight in an airtight container to allow the flavour to mature Serve at room temperature

I decided on a Raspberry and Blueberry Pistachio Almond Crumble I m saving the strawberries so sweet to enjoy with Sweetened Whipped Cream one of my favourite treats I have a jar of homemade vanilla sugar tucked away for the perfect opportunity where it could shine It did just that in this Fruit Crumble The sugar was so fragrant and when the crumbles were baking the aroma was pure heaven It also provided the perfect amount of vanilla flavouring I ve always preferred the flavour of a nutty topping and the crunchy texture was a wonderful compliment to the soft fruit filling The topping was also rich in butter everything is always better with butter flavour especially with the yellow golden sugar that I used I love to serve and enjoy my berry crumbles piping hot with a scoop of creamy vanilla ice cream The melting creaminess with the hot cold combination gets me each and every time If you enjoy raspberries as much as I do The Professor s Smith Bites Raspberry Gelato would be amazing with

crumbles warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or sweetened whipped cream I have a large mason jar of vanilla sugar on my kitchen island I use a lot of vanilla beans and I can t bear to throw them out after one use After I ve used the bean in my recipe I wash the bean and then hang it to dry Once the vanilla bean is dry I pop into the jar and top it up with sugar If I m making compote and I want a hint of vanilla I either add some of the sugar or I will cut a piece from one of the pods and add it to the saucepan when simmering the fruit The sugar can be used in so many different ways from macerating fruit to flavouring morning coffee 225 g 1 cup caster superfine granules sugar1 vanilla beanPlace sugar in a bowl With sharp paring knife slice vanilla bean lengthwise in half to expose seeds Scrape seeds and add to sugar Whisk sugar and seeds together until vanilla seeds are evenly distributed Pour sugar into a resealable jar Bury vanilla bean in the sugar Cover and allow

Disneyland I spend more time at Disneyland than any man in his early 30s should probably ever admit One of the main reasons for this is that the food is pretty exceptional and it seems like I make a new culinary discovery every time I go back That said it s high time I post an addendum to the list I crafted last year This time I ve broadened the scope to include food at Disney s California Adventure which sits directly across from Disneyland 10 Soft Serve Swirl Cone at Catch a Flave California Adventure image courtesy of byronface I m not a huge ice cream eater but the urge struck me just right one hot summer day and I indulged in a swirl cone And oh my goodness The ice cream was incredibly creamy and rich bordering on frozen custard it seemed 9 Lobster Nachos at Ariel s Grotto California Adventure image courtesy of byronface Whenever I order lobster nachos at a restaurant I usually have the same complaint too much chip not enough lobster Not the case here Ariel s Grotto piles on a surprisingly heavy helping of the crustacean and not a single chip goes unused 8 Chocolate Covered Peanut Butter Sandwich at Greetings from California California Adventure I haven t tried every confection at the sweets counter in California Adventure and I m sure plenty of them merit mention But the peanut butter sandwich is definitely a standout among what I have tried A thick creamy layer of peanut butter on a perfectly crisp cookie slathered in the ideal amount of chocolate Drool 7 Cobb Salad at Plaza Inn Disneyland I know what you re thinking I m shocked that there s a salad on this list too But if you ve ever had the Disneyland cobb salad you ll know why it s here And you ll also know that it s hardly the salad you order when you re watching your figure Mounds of cheese meat and goodness of all kinds tossed in a creamy blue cheese dressing with a breadstick on the side It s a staple in my Disneyland diet Plus if you don t feel like fighting the fireworks crowd at night you can buy a salad plop down in the Plaza Inn s ample seating area and enjoy a decent view of the exploding night sky above the hedges that line the restaurant s patio 6 Bleu Cheese and Wine Pairing at Terrace Wine Tasting California Adventure I don t know much about wine but I love listening to people who do And the staff at the Terrace Wine Tasting bar at California Adventure certainly seems to know its stuff The bleu cheese and red wine pairing was a lot of fun The cheeses delicious in their own right were paired perfectly with their red wine counterparts And I had a Disney cast member on hand the whole time to walk me through what I was tasting and explain why it all worked so well together 5 Jumbo Rice Krispie Treat at Greetings from California California Adventure Much like the peanut butter sandwich you just have to eat one to understand And I recommend you do Never has a more sublime krispie to mallow ratio been achieved 4 Cheddar Broccoli Soup in a Bread Bowl at Pacific Wharf Caf\u00e9 California Adventure The soup is quite good But you order it for the bread bowl which is phenomenal How can it not be when it was just pulled out of the oven at the Boudin bakery next door 3 Free Fresh Tortilla at the Mission Tortilla Factory California Adventure The brief tour at the Mission Tortilla Factory at California Adventure is cute and it s worth doing once So why have I done the tour more than an estimated two dozen times Because of the free fresh off the conveyor belt tortilla at the end of course And come on how many things at a theme park are free 2 Fried Chicken Dinner at Plaza Inn Disneyland I owe this discovery to a friend She wouldn t stop talking about the chicken dinner at the Plaza Inn and I finally gave it a try just to shut her up But man she was right It s not just good because it s fried chicken It s good fried chicken You win again Disneyland And the fireworks view I mentioned with the cobb salad applies here too 1 Family Style Barbecue Feast at Big Thunder Ranch Barbecue Disneyland One of Disneyland s newest dining options is also one of its most noteworthy Dinner at the ranch is a family style all you can eat extravaganza of barbecue chicken and ribs smoked sausages cole slaw baked beans corn on the cob and cornbread It comes at a price a few bucks shy of 30 a person but the food is good the setting is rustic and relaxing and there s no loophole to the all you can eat clause Before we even touched our meal my friend demanded an extra bucket filled exclusively with ribs And our waitress happily obliged that time as well as several other times during the course of our dinner as i confessed in my earlier post, \u201ctop 10 best foods at disneyland,\u201d i spend more time at disneyland than any man in his

blood"",""body"":""Researchers recently announced the beginning of a FDA approved clinical trial that uses umbilical cord blood stem cells to cure autism Dr Michael Chez director of pediatric neurology at Sutter Neuroscience Institute in Sacramento Calif said he and his colleagues have been processing the trial for more than a year now and they have high hopes it will succeed The data is scattered with glimmers of potential benefit Dr Michael Chez director of pediatric neurology at Sutter Neuroscience Institute in Sacramento Calif What we are looking at is cases that don t have an obvious genetic link Chez told FoxNews com Patients that we presume something went wrong with their brains which caused a change to autistic features Related Cord blood cures baby s grapefruit sized tumor In other words the trial s patients will essentially have no reason to have autism or at least no genetic markers for the disease This means they must have presumably developed it through another factor such as the environment or exposure to an infection Chez got the idea to treat autism with cord blood stem cells when he observed the cells make a big difference for a little boy who had cerebral palsy Related Cord blood reverses cerebral palsy in Colorado girl Now Chez wants to put this boy s experience to work for children with autism Autism is a developmental disorder that appears in a child s first three years of life according to the National Institutes of Health One in 88 U S children have it and it affects one in 54 boys The condition impacts the brain s normal development of social and communication skills sometimes mildly sometimes extremely More children will be diagnosed with autism this year than with AIDS diabetes and cancer combined according to AutismSpeaks org We want to see if there is any benefit to giving them an infusion to redirect the nervous system cells which may have programmed themselves due to a secondary factor Chez said This may work on autism on different mechanisms in theory by modifying either the immune system or modifying the nervous system by indirect or direct methods Putting the cord blood to work Chez will give 30 kids infusions of their own cord blood cells Most of the children for the trial have already been lined up and they have been screened to make sure they don t have any other issues that may have caused their autism for example Fragile X syndrome stroke head injury or prematurity Using the child s own cord blood will make the study safe and ethical plus the cells are younger and have not been exposed to environmental factors like viruses or chemicals which can alter the cell s function and structure By using the children s own stem cells their bodies cannot reject them However in the future a sibling s cord blood could theoretically work as long as the siblings shared the same blood type Researchers can develop further goals when and if they see results The next level of research will be to determine how that works Chez said Everyone in the pilot study will get a dose of cord blood however the children will be divided into two groups Group 1 will receive an initial infusion of cord blood while Group 2 will receive a placebo saline infusion The groups will be observed over the course of six months and then the groups will reverse Group 1 will receive a dose of saline and Group 2 will receive the cord blood cells Chez is hoping to see results of the study within six weeks Autism studies involving stem cells are nothing new several have already occurred overseas However they weren t necessarily controlled studies or the stem cells may have come from an open pool of donors The data is scattered with glimmers of potential benefit Chez said There are also patients who have gone to other countries and gotten so called cord blood on their own and we re getting anecdotal Internet studies that we don t want to be misinterpreted We want to do this in a scientific way and make sure it s not just these parents are so hopeful they are seeing a placebo effect If the results are that dramatic and turn the children s symptoms around rapidly then Chez feels the stem cells will be talking to other cells within the body causing those cells to become more functional than dysfunctional In theory it would take more than that time for the nervous system cells to grow he said It might be more than growing tissue It may be a simple infusion and it doesn t have to travel to your brain Heather Brown vice president of scientific and medical affairs at CBR said it is exciting to partner with researchers and clinicians like Chez who are pursuing a scientifically sound approach in evaluating new therapeutic uses for cord blood stem cells for conditions that

learning good life we have received lots of mail with requests to clarify some of the complexities of sleep theory Many people have sleep problems and look for simple solutions applicable in their lives The present article attempts to explain the main reason for which healthy people may not be getting refreshing sleep sleep phase problems The article is accompanied by a simple freeware SleepChart application that may help you plan optimum sleep The cycle of sleep and waking is regulated by the body clock Body clock is located in the brain suprachiasmatic nucleus The clock has a period of about 24 hours During a single 24 hour day we have a period of 6 10 hours when we are very sleepy This is the time when we normally sleep During the remaining 14 18 hours we are usually awake however only a portion of that waking time is suitable for intellectual effort This period of maximum alertness may last as little as 2 6 hours We should plan our day in such a way that sleep comes at the time of maximum sleepiness while activities that demand maximum focus or creativity fall into the hours of maximum alertness It is very difficult and usually very unhealthy to force your body and your body clock to do what you wish It is far easier to do the opposite adapt your life to your body clock This article is intended to help you understand your body clock Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome DSPS is a sleep disorder in which an individual finds it difficult to fall asleep late in the night and sleeps well into the afternoon if not awakened DSPS has only been characterized in 1982 but increasing data indicates that various degrees of DSPS occur with epidemic frequency esp among high school and university students DSPS individuals often like to keep on learning late into the night go to sleep very late for example 4 6 am and find it very hard to wake up early on a regular basis For example regular getting up at 7 am is a pure torture for individuals affected with DSPS They often fail to keep jobs that require them to perform early in the morning Very often they tend to split the day sleep into two components For example DSPS students often get a short sleep in the night wake up early with an alarm clock go to school where they are semi conscious and perform poorly get a solid nap after school and only late in the evening they regain vigor and their full mental powers DSPS students feel best after midnight when everyone else is asleep and they can focus on learning or other activities reading Internet watching TV computer games etc The main factors contributing to DSPS increased period of the body clock well above 25 hours reduced or increased sensitivity to factors that reset or advance body clock e g light activity stress etc electric lighting 24 hour economy and the resulting want to do more lifestyle A normal individual has a body clock running with a period slightly longer than 24 hours The clock is reset in the morning with activity and bright light Thus a normal individual easily adjusts to the standard day night cycle However DSPS individuals may have their clocks running periods long enough to find it hard to fit to 24 hours They also push their clocks ahead by activity late in the evening the process opposite to the morning reset synchronization DSPS individuals when given a chance to sleep when they want will tend to go to sleep later and later They will also wake up later and later DSPS people do not have problems with sleep if they sleep in their favorite hours Most mild DSPS cases can be remedied by changes in lifestyle but rarely are those changes painless to individuals affected with the condition If this description fits your problem you may diagnose the degree of your DSPS with SleepChart freeware at the bottom of this article Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome ASPS is the opposite of DSPS People suffering from ASPS get very sleepy early in the evening and wake up very early in the night They circadian clock runs at less than 24 hour period As they constantly struggle to survive to a reasonable evening hour they sleep less awake early and experience increased tiredness during the day While a typical DSPS person is an adolescent student a typical ASPS person is a retiree or a middle age low stress tolerance woman The link between the age and sleep phase disorders may be related to aging itself however it may also be a result of lifestyle changes that come with age Correlates of sleep phase syndromes DSPS is more prevalent among adolescents while ASPS is more frequently observed in aging population DSPS is also by far more frequent among students programmers avid readers passionate artists computer game addicts etc ASPS seems more likely in individuals whose life is deprived of intense stimulation esp in the evening who meet fewer new challenges or who are not facing information overload stress etc Finally there is a complex relationship between DSPS ASPS and depression mania On one hand there may be a link between DSPS and manic personalities Anti depressants tend to increase the period of the body clock e g clorgyline imipramine On the other paradoxically DSPS individuals may be more likely to suffer from depression e g when in conditions of insomnia sleep deprivation resulting social problems etc Similarly low stress tolerance depressed individuals are more likely to suffer from ASPS Again when they are forced to adapt to normal life their symptoms of depression tend to weaken as sleep deprivation here counteracts depression The cause effect relationship between sleep phase disorders and mood disorders is complex Understanding it will contribute substantially to solving the escalating epidemic of sleep phase disorders It is not known which are the predominant underlying physiological factors that result in sleep phase disorders Family clusters show that genes may affect the length of the circadian period The lifestyle may affect levels of neurotransmitters and these could affect the period of the circadian clock Conversely the level of neurotransmitters may select for a specific lifestyle choices Age may have a direct impact on the clock circuits it may affect neurotransmitters or it can affect the lifestyle Last but not least sleep phase disorders will affect the mood and the levels of neurotransmitters in varying ways depending on whether free running sleep is used to remedy the disorder or wherever the individual attempts to fit a predetermined desirable sleep schedule How body regulates sleepiness There are two main mechanisms that regulate sleepiness One is the body clock and the other is the wake meter Body clock produces increased sleepiness every 24 hours The wake meter increases sleepiness with prolonged wakefulness i e the longer we do not sleep the sleepier we are In sleep literature these two mechanisms are called the circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep Sleep control components circadian clock circadian clock produces sleepiness in 24 hour cycles homeostatic control wake meter measures the period in which we stay awake and triggers sleepiness after we stay up for long enough In DSPS or ASPS people there may exist a combination of several factors that make it harder to get good sleep Circadian clock runs in periods far different from 24 hours In DSPS people the circadian clock may be set to 25 26 hours In ASPS people it could be 23 hours Circadian clock is not sensitive to time resetting factors professionally termed zeitgebers Normal people reset their clock in the morning by light and activity In addition darkness and inactivity in the evening provide further clues for the clock Normal people with normal lifestyles can easily synchronize their sleep with the day night cycle Homeostatic wake meter shows changed sensitivity Sensitive wake meter will make people get tired very quickly after awakening Insensitive wake meter may make people tend to stay up for long Lifestyle has a dramatic effect on the behavior of the circadian and homeostatic sleep regulation mechanisms The same individual will show different sleep rhythm depending on such factors as using artificial lighting exercise level of stress timing of exciting activities napping diet climate changes in ambient temperature health status etc Examples of different sleeping rhythms Freeware SleepChart application that comes with this article bottom makes it possible to take a snapshot of sleep that graphically illustrates DSPS and ASPS rhythms 24 hour cycle Let us first consider an ideally synchronized 24 hour cycle In the picture below an octogenarian female wakes up naturally everyday around 3 00 3 30 am She sleeps 5 4 5 5 hours per day wakes up refreshed and is active throughout the day There is no synchronization with daylight as the waking hour falls into the period of darkness The cycle is synchronized by evening activities The subjects keeps in her mind a must go to sleep hour estimation that helps synchronize body clock with the time of day This psychological imprint is illustrated by a smooth change in the sleeping rhythm after the end of the daylight saving time on Sunday October 27 2002 the graph disregards DST so that the waking hour before the change is set at 2 00 2 30 am 24 hour cycle and stress Let us now consider the impact of stress on a well synchronized sleeping rhythm In the picture below a middle aged self employed male wakes up naturally everyday around 6 00 6 20 However on June 3 2003 a severe family problem throws the rhythm into chaos as evidenced by frequent nocturnal awakenings The rhythm returned to norm one month later as soon as the family conflict was resolved Asynchronous DSPS People suffering from DSPS find it difficult to synchronize with 24 hour clock In the picture below adolescent female with a mild DSPS suffers disintegration of the sleeping rhythm due to the failed efforts to synchronize with civilized life After the vacation period she begins in early September well synchronized with the rest of the world She wakes up between 6 30 and 10 00 However her body clock experiences continuous shift of optimum sleeping hours Soon she wakes up at 12 00 and begins a struggle against the further shift This results in disintegration of the sleep cycle short sleep periods e g 4 hours and frequent bouts of tiredness The presented software attempts to plot the hours of maximum natural sleepiness between red and brown lines Clearly the greatest disturbance in sleep occurs at the point where the natural rhythm departs furthest from the desired rhythm Mild DSPS cases are able to force the body clock to remain more or less in the desired bounds at the cost of constant struggle with sleepiness In more severe cases the circadian variables will run a 24 hour cycle and the individual will experience return to good sleep when free running variables align again with the desired sleep period In the graph below October 7 sleep period is almost aligning with the hours of maximum sleepiness resulting in good long refreshing sleep The average sleep length is 6 8 hours but it changes widely The average DSPS shift is difficult to determine due to the struggle with the natural rhythm however if is likely to be above 60 minutes as evidenced at the beginning of the graph Synchronous DSPS A graph below presents a sleep rhythm of a middle aged self employed male A very clear and regular DSPS pattern visible in the graph with a daily phase shift of 64 68 minutes Although sleeping in unnatural hours is certainly less beneficial healthwise than normal sleep for a DSPS patient free running sleep rhythm may by far less stressful and disruptive than any attempt to fit to standard lifestyle as shown above There have been cases in literature that documented people living along such shifting DSPS schedule for decades without major health side effects although some authors claim increased incidence of depression alcoholism or dependence on sedatives as a result of attempts to induce sleep A very reliable determinant of synchronous DSPS is the disruption of the link between the sleep onset hour and sleep duration As the duration of sleep is determined by the circadian phase well synchronized sleep schedule shows little variability in the sleep length 6 6 hours in the graph below In particular the sleep length is independent of the sleep onset hour Wherever the patient makes any attempt to synchronize with daylight or daylight related activities the link between sleep length and the onset hour will be reconstituted Mistakenly DSPS people are often called owls for their tendency to stay up late while ASPS people are called larks The graph below illustrates why this is a misnomer SleepChart A sleep charting and scheduling application You can download a freeware SleepChart application by clicking the link at the bottom of the article All you need to do in the program is to click the beginning and the end of the sleep block in the graph See the bottom of the display for exact hour points corresponding to the position of the mouse pointer If you set a wrong block select it by clicking and press Del SleepChart will attempt to approximate the circadian low that correlates with high sleepiness low temperature low ACTH high melatonin etc The underlying assumption is that you do not attempt to regulate your sleep This means that you do not wake up with an alarm clock or do not struggle against the sleepiness in the evening e g in order to delay sleep Currently there is no option that would let you eliminate artificially regulated sleep blocks This means that all attempts to modify your sleep schedule will fool the algorithm and your reading will be inaccurate or plain wrong It is also very important that you do not attempt to follow the circadian approximation when determining your optimum sleep hours This can result in a positive feedback of error and disintegration of the sleep cycle In other words errors in the graph may be amplified by your attempts to follow the graph At worst you could even self diagnose yourself with DSPS without actually suffering from the disorder Your only and sole go to sleep criterion should be rapidly increasing sleepiness You may use the graph to approximate the moment in which the readiness for sleep will occur You can also find it helpful in chronotherapy for ASPS or DSPS to make it easier to schedule your appointments without conflicting with your natural sleep rhythm Circadian graph in DSPS The circadian graph can help you better understand your sleep rhythm with its homeostatic and circadian components You will need a few months of data before the graph becomes meaningful In addition sleep boundary approximation lines are subject to substantial hysteresis If your lifestyle changes dramatically e g as a result of therapy you may need a few weeks for the approximation lines to align properly with data The circadian graph may then be more difficult to interpret Having separate data sets for such circumstances solves the problem Homeostatic The blue line corresponds with homeostatic sleepiness derived from the number of sleep blocks falling into a given hour of the waking day i e where zero refers to the hour of waking It roughly expresses your tiredness of wakefulness It also expresses your ability to fall asleep From the graph below you can read that the best chances of falling asleep fall around 18th hour of wakefulness assuming the graph is created without any artificial form of regulating sleep such as the alarm clock delaying sleep etc Your own optimum hour is naturally likely to differ check with SleepChart For most people the optimum hour falls into the range 16 20 If your graph looks like below and you wake up at 6 am you can conclude that you can best go to sleep shortly before midnight so that you could ensure you are in bed when the 18th hour of wakefulness comes up Some people take naps during the day Others don t The graph below is typical of a regular napper with the optimum nap time coming at 7 8 hour of wakefulness For example if you get up at 6 and your optimum nap time hits the 8th hour you should take a break around 14 and look for a secluded place for a few minutes of rest Naturally planning your lunch at 13 00 or so would be recommended too In the graph below 8 2 of sleep blocks begin in the 18th hour night sleep while another 8 1 begin in the 8th hour nap Non nappers will also experience a peak of sleepiness around the 7th hour even though their blue line graph will not show as prominent a bulge as below Circadian The red line corresponds with circadian sleepiness derived from the average length of sleep blocks started at a given hour of the waking day The graph indicates that even if you are able to initiate sleep during the day it will never last long Only after 14 hours of waking does the length of initiated sleep reach beyond 6 hours Maximum length of sleep can be achieved at 15th hour however this does not indicate this is the optimum hour of going to sleep If sleep is initiated too early it may or may not make it possible to catch on the full circadian low In other words we can wake up after just a couple of minutes of sleep and make it harder to fall asleep again due to instantly losing the homeostatic sleepiness In addition sleep initiated before the full circadian low does not seem to be of more value that slightly shorter sleep initiated a bit later e g as reflected by the subjective feeling of being refreshed in the morning or as measured polysomnographically The blue homeostatic line indicates that the sleep is more likely initiated at 18th hour while its average length is 6 5 hours If your graph is generated without attempts to artificially regulate sleep the second peak in the homeostatic curve may indicate your optimum hour of retirement The graph indicates that if you delay your sleep by one hour it will be shortened by 10 30 minutes It is possible that even this little shortening will affect your performance during the day If you advance your sleep by one hour it may be 10 30 minutes longer but its quality is not likely to increase In addition you run the risk of premature awakening breaks in sleep are ignored in the graph as this makes it easier to determine the circadian low Phase shift graph in DSPS The phase shift graph may be used by people suffering from ASPS and DSPS This graphs helps you see at what time you are likely to fall asleep for a given waking time For example in the graph below you can see that if your waking time comes at 7 am your best retirement hour blue line comes at 1 am However if you happen to wake up naturally at 11 am you are not likely to be ready for sleep before 5 am the next day The lighter pink and gray lines indicate the timing of a nap Again if you wake up at 7 am your best napping time might occur between 15 00 and 16 00 Remember Each individual will have a his or her own unique graph Moreover the graph will look differently if it is taken at times of work or at times of summer vacation It will be affected by stresses at work and at home It may even change when you move from one house to another or when you change the climate zone The graph will slope only for people with sleep phase problems and will accurately reflect your rhythm only if you adhere to free running sleep If you use an alarm clock this graph will be meaningless Download To download SleepChart a freeware sleep scheduling application for Windows click here Note for users of SuperMemo The algorithm used by SleepChart may be

sun booth lashes out at critics patricia krencil: tanning mom who 'took daughter, 5, to sun booth' lashes out at critics"",""body"":""Patricia Krantcil plead not guilty calls herself a wonderful mother By Daily Mail Reporter PUBLISHED 15 06 EST 3 May 2012 UPDATED 19 06 EST 3 May 2012 The New Jersey mother who is accused of bringing her daughter into a tanning booth with her thinks that she is a the subject of witch hunt There s somebody out there for my whole life that doesn t like me because they are jealous fat and they re ugly Patricia Krencil told a reporter on Thursday Krentcil entered a not guilty plea to her child endangerment charge in court on Wednesday and she continues to claim that the arrest was simply the result of a misunderstanding SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO In court Patricia Krentcil appeared at her arraignment on Wednesday because she was charged with child endangerment for allegedly taking her 5 year old daughter tanning Pale family Anna 5 is seen being held by her father Rich Krentcil and shown with her brother Addison as the children are still living at home with their mother in spite of the charges I would never ever put my daughter in a tanning booth she told a TMZ reporter Any mother who makes an accusation about me is not a mother because I m a great mother I would never do that to my child The saga began when the teacher of Krentcil s fair skinned red haired daughter Anna noticed serious burns on the 5 year old s body Pictures emerged today of Anna along with her brother Addison in the arms of their father Rich Krentcil at their Nutley New Jersey home Mr Krentcil a 47 year old trader stood up for his wife in spite of the fact that neighbors have said she went tanning while pregnant with Anna They re making her out to be a monster he told The Daily News She just likes it She s not a crazy maniac where she has to tan every day Center of the action Anna Krentcil 5 seen with her father Rich on the right was apparently so sunburned that her teacher noticed and notified authorities Standing guard Patricia Krentcil was caught looking at the paparazzi outside of her Nutley New Jersey home Patricia Krentcil however stayed away from the front door but couldn t keep too far out of the action as she was seen peering out her upstairs window to keep watch Krentcil said that while she did take her daughter Anna to the tanning salon the little girl never got in the booth and was only there waiting for her mother to finish her session She argues that Anna got her sunburn from playing in the yard and not breaking the law Doctors say tanning booths which emit UV radiation are known carcinogens Krentcil s daughter apparently received enough of the radiation to burn her skin and leave her with painful damage police say Her attorney John Caruso disagrees as he said that Krentcil will be exonerated because the evidence will show the child never entered the booth Forget about the presumption of innocence my client is 150 per cent innocent Caruso said She loves that child more than her whole life She would never ever allow her child to go inside a tanning bed The child is still living at home with her mother Caruso told Municipal Court Judge Roslyn Holmes Grant though he said the state s child welfare agency is monitoring the family Krentcil said she loves tanning and has visited salons for many years but would not do anything to jeopardize her daughter s health Mother and daughter The difference in hue of Krentcil left and Anna right is blatantly obvious Shocked Krentcil left and her daughter Anna right have been shaken up by the attention from the arrest Never in my life would I endanger my child by putting her in a tanning booth I m not dumb she said before her scheduled hearing Outside court she called herself a wonderful mother Mug shot Krentcil clearly went tanning after her April 24 arrest seen here as she is darker in recent imagesThe Bergen County Record reports that employees the tanning salon in Nutley New Jersey didn t realize Krentcil had brought her daughter into the stand up tanning booth State law prohibits children under 14 from using tanning booths Anyone under 18 must have parental permission The incident was reported when a teacher at Anna s school overheard Anna telling a friend that she went to the tanning salon with her mom and then the teacher pieced that together with Anna s noticeable sunburn I tan she doesn t tan Krentcil said stating the obvious With her skin reminiscent of the outlandish character Magda from the 1998 comedy There s Something About Mary it is very clear that Krentcil has been to more than one tanning session in her time Fighting for her case Krentcil left says that it was all a misunderstanding and that she did not take her daughter in the booth but only in the room while she herself was tanning Facing the heat Krentcil entered a plea of not guilty in court on Wednesday Trip to the salon Krentcil argues the girl was in the room but not in the actual booth Even given the timing of her mugshot taken on April 24 and her Today Show interview which aired on May 2 the difference in her skin tone makes it clear that her legal scuffle didn t stop her from making a stop at the tanning salon in the meantime Krentcil says her daughter did not break any laws by going in the room with her but not in the actual tanning booth It s called a tanning booth and a tanning room The legal situation has taken a toll on both Krentcil and Anna Its traumatizing for a little girl who did nothing wrong but got a little sunburn Krentcil told Today Tan Patricia Krentcil 44 allegedly took her daughter tanning but says that it was a misunderstanding Police arrested Krentcil April 24 She took the child to the tanning salon the week before authorities say The charge was upgraded to a felony Monday and Krentcil was released after posting 25 000 bail A family told WABC TV that Krentcil was shaken by her arrest Dr Stephanie Badalamenti a dermatologist told the station tanning booths can increase the risk of developing melanoma a deadly form of skin cancer by 75 percent This can be very dangerous she said This can be a

everything..."",""body"":""Practising yoga can help you lose weight manage health problems and keep you at the top of your mental peak Aquarius talks to Dubai based yoga instructor Elaine Kelly who conducts the annual yoga fest at Dubai Internet City about the benefits of this ancient art form Can yoga balance the body s hormonal system Hormone imbalance can affect a women at any stage in her life but the time when this is most likely to happen and have prolonged side effects as a consequence is during menopause As the body prepares for this change the endocrine system which produces and regulates the hormones in the body can become erratic sending the body on a roller coaster ride This is when the women will experience menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes mood swings and irregular periods Yoga is considered one of the most effective techniques for balancing hormone levels because of the close relationship it has with the endocrine system and the organs and glands that are a part of it Yoga has an immediate effect on the endocrine system and the hormonal and glandular changes that take place The poses or asanas encourage fresh blood flow to all the glands causing them to be gently pressurised and depressurised This is the movement that has a positive effect on the endocrine system The practice of yoga and the way in which it incorporates controlled movements controlled breathing and an aspect of meditation allows this to happen Article continues below Additionally yoga allows your mind and body to feel relaxed and de stressed When a woman is stressed the adrenal gland produces a stress hormone called cortisol which has a direct impact on the levels of estrogen and progesterone that are produced causing the imbalance of hormones to be made worse Alleviating stress from your life through yoga will prevent this from happening What are the physiological benefits of yoga Physicians and scientists are discovering brand new health benefits of yoga everyday Studies show it can relieve the symptoms of several common and potentially life threatening illnesses such as arthritis arteriosclerosis chronic fatigue diabetes AIDS asthma and obesity Asthma Studies conducted at yoga institutions in India have reported impressive success in improving asthma It has also been proved that asthma attacks can usually be prevented by yoga methods without resorting to drugs Physicians have found that the addition of improved concentration abilities and yogic meditation together with the practice of simple postures and pranayama makes treatment more effective Yoga practice also results in greater reduction in anxiety scores than drug therapy Doctors believe that yoga practice helps patients by enabling them to gain access to their own internal experience and increased self awareness Respiration problems Patients who practice yoga have a better chance of gaining the ability to control their breathing problems With the help of yogic breathing exercises it is possible to control an attack of severe shortness of breath without having to seek medical help Various studies have confirmed the beneficial effects of yoga for patients with respiratory problems High blood pressure The relaxation and exercise components of yoga have a major role to play in the treatment and prevention of high blood pressure hypertension A combination of biofeedback and yogic breathing and relaxation techniques has been found to lower blood pressure and reduce the need for high blood pressure medication in people suffering from it Pain management Yoga is believed to reduce pain by helping the brain s pain centre regulate the gate controlling mechanism located in the spinal cord and the secretion of natural painkillers in the body Breathing exercises used in yoga can also reduce pain Because muscles tend to relax when you exhale lengthening the time of exhalation can help produce relaxation and reduce tension Awareness of breathing helps to achieve calmer slower respiration and aid in relaxation and pain management Yoga s inclusion of relaxation techniques and meditation can also help reduce pain Part of the effectiveness of yoga in reducing pain is due to its focus on self awareness This self awareness can have a protective effect and allow for early preventive action Back pain Back pain is the most common reason to seek medical attention Yoga has consistently been used to cure and prevent back pain by enhancing strength and flexibility Both acute and long term stress can lead to muscle tension and exacerbate back problems Arthritis Yoga s gentle exercises designed to provide relief to needed joints had been Yoga s slow motion movements and gentle pressures reach deep into troubled joints In addition the easy stretches in conjunction with deep breathing exercises relieve the tension that binds up the muscles and further tightens the joints Yoga is exercise and relaxation rolled into one the perfect anti arthritis formula Weight reduction Regular yoga practice can help in weight management Firstly some of the asanas stimulate sluggish glands to increase their hormonal secretions The thyroid gland especially has a big effect on our weight because it affects body metabolism There are several asanas such as the shoulder stand and the fish posture which are specific for the thyroid gland Fat metabolism is also increased so fat is converted to muscle and energy This means that as well as losing fat you will have better muscle tone and a higher vitality level What are the mental and emotional benefits of yoga Mental performance A common technique used in yoga is breathing through one nostril at a time Electroencephalogram EEG studies of the electrical impulses of the brain have shown that breathing through one nostril results in increased activity on the opposite side of the brain Some experts suggest that the regular practice of breathing through one nostril may help improve communication between the right and left side of the brain Studies have also shown that this increased brain activity is associated with better performance and doctors even suggest that yoga can enhance cognitive performance Mood change and vitality Mental health and physical energy are difficult to quantify but virtually everyone who participates in yoga over a period of time reports a positive effect on outlook and energy level Yogic stretching and breathing exercises have been seen to result in an invigorating effect on both mental and physical energy and improved mood Spiritual Benefits When you achieve the yogic spirit you can begin knowing yourself at peace The value of discovering one s self and of enjoying one s self as is begins a journey into being rather than doing Life can then be lived practicing yoga off the mat Pride Pride and especially anxiety about pride is something which Hatha Yoga seeks to diminish or eliminate To one who has been dejected because he cannot do his work properly when he becomes tired irritable or haggard any degree of refreshment may be accompanied by additional degrees of self respect Can long term yoga practice decrease stress To talk about stress we have to talk about the hormone cortisol Under normal conditions your brain slowly releases cortisol into your body to make your muscles work However if you re highly stressed late for work deadline due screaming baby your brain thinks there s an emergency and responds by flooding your body with cortisol If there really was an emergency you would need this much cortisol to deal with broken bones excessive bleeding and so on But if you re just stressed out by life excess cortisol can lead to ulcers high blood pressure bone density loss and can throw your immune system out of whack which is why we get sick when we re stressed It can also lead to weight gain because the body thinks it s responding to an emergency and so holds onto as much fat as it can Your nervous system has several branches One of these branches controls what your internal organs are doing and it has two parts the sympathetic or fight or flight state which ramps up when you are stressed and dumps cortisol into your bloodstream and the parasympathetic or rest and digest state which controls more day to day functions So if we re trying to get less stressed we ll need to harness that rest and digest state The only problem is these two states are happening automatically within our bodies and we can t control them However yoga has an answer The diaphragm the muscle that we use to breathe mostly functions automatically but we can also control our breathing when we want to like holding our breath underwater So if we practice specific breathing patterns called pranayama in yoga we can slip ourselves into that rest and digest state and allow our minds and bodies to get some relief Can long term yoga practice boost your mood The practice of yoga asanas particularly back bends are highly associated with the positive emotional effects that are produced with the practice of yoga After the completion of these exercises one feels more exuberant Depression therapy or other types of psychological therapy involve a great deal of back bends since these poses help to open up your chest During this action you are able to release any negative emotions such as anger anxiety stress and fear Once you have let go of these you will feel reinvigorated and renewed But this is more than just psychological since expanded lung capacity is physiologically considered to affect your mood and behaviour Which style of yoga is best for getting your heart pumping Ashtanga or vinyasa yoga elevates the heart rate as the poses flow continuously and include many sun salutations Which style of yoga is best for a detoxifying sweat Bikram yoga taught in a hot room creates the most sweat even though it is not the most vigorous or energetic styles of yoga Which style of yoga is best for chilling out Restorative yoga allows the body to relax in various positions using props like bolsters and blankets Poses are held for up to five minutes health, hospital, medicine, disease, treatment, pharmacy, drugs, yoga,

with other tissues as well"",""body"":""ScienceDaily July 24 2012 Researchers at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland RCSI have developed a new method of repairing bone using synthetic bone graft substitute material which combined with gene therapy can mimic real bone tissue and has potential to regenerate bone in patients who have lost large areas of bone from either disease or trauma The researchers have developed an innovative scaffold material made from collagen and nano sized particles of hydroxyapatite which acts as a platform to attract the body s own cells and repair bone in the damaged area using gene therapy The cells are tricked into overproducing bone producing proteins known as BMPs encouraging regrowth of healthy bone tissue This is the first time these in house synthesised nanoparticles have been used in this way and the method has potential to be applied to regenerate tissues in other parts of the body Professor Fergal O Brien Principal Investigator on the project explained Previously synthetic bone grafts had proven successful in promoting new bone growth by infusing the scaffold material with bone producing proteins These proteins are already clinically approved for bone repair in humans but concerns exist that the high doses of protein required in clinical treatments may potentially have negative side effects for the patient such as increasing the risk of cancer Other existing gene therapies use viral methods which also carry risks By stimulating the body to produce the bone producing protein itself using non viral methods these negative side effects can be avoided and bone tissue growth is promoted efficiently and safely Professor O Brien said The research is the result of a collaborative project carried out between the Tissue Engineering Research Group led by Professor Fergal O Brien and Dr Garry Duffy in the Department of Anatomy RCSI Professor Kazuhisa Bessho Kyoto University Japan and Dr Glenn Dickson Queen s University Belfast Northern Ireland and consists of a multi disciplinary research effort between cell biologists clinicians and engineers Results of this study were recently published in the journal Advanced Materials with Dr Caroline Curtin a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Anatomy RCSI as first author Bone grafts are second only to blood transfusions on the list of transplanted materials worldwide with approximately 2 2 million procedures performed annually 1 at an estimated cost of 2 5 billion per year 2 At present the majority of these procedures involve either transplanting bone from another part of the patient s own body autograft or from a donor allograft However these procedures have a number of risks such as infections or the bone not growing properly at the area of transplantation Therefore there is a large potential market for bone graft substitute materials such as the innovative scaffolds being developed by the RCSI team and their collaborators While the biomaterials developed in this project have undoubted potential for bone repair with the capability to act as a superior alternative to existing bone graft treatments this gene delivery platform may also have significant potential in the regeneration of other degenerated or diseased tissues in the body when combined with different therapeutic genes This is currently a major focus of ongoing research in the Tissue Engineering Research Group which has a particular interest in using the platform to deliver genes that promote the formation of blood vessels using angiogenic genes in the regeneration of tissues which suffer from compromised blood supply such as heart wall tissue which has been damaged following a heart attack This research was funded by the European Research Council under the European Community s Seventh Framework Programme and a Science Foundation Ireland President of Ireland Young Researcher Award 1 Lewandrowski KU Gresser JD Wise DL Trantol DJ

New strain of TB may yet succumb to some antibiotic but victory will be short lived An obscure report from researchers in India appeared online late last year and sent a shiver through the medical community In the weeks since then the report has come under close scrutiny As well it should since it suggests we could lose a century of progress and find ourselves dying in the millions from tuberculosis just like our 19th century ancestors According to the original report published Dec 21 in Clinical Infectious Diseases a hospital in Mumbai India had identified 12 TB patients whose disease resisted all antibiotics Nothing worked with them All the patients appeared to have strains of TB known as multi drug resistant MDR TB and extremely drug resistant XDR TB They had been given antibiotics but had not completed their course of treatment Or they had been given the wrong antibiotics altogether a common experience worldwide Anything that doesn t kill the TB bacillus makes it stronger and the doctors at PD Hinduja Hospital found nothing that could kill these patients TB As an Indian news report began This is as scary as it can get Scary but not surprising Ever since the advent of sulfa drugs and penicillin we have been locked in an arms race with bacteria Antibiotics originally had wonderfully lethal effects on many infections But in some cases a few bacteria had genetic resistance to a given drug or the treatment wasn t long or intense enough Either way the survivors learned to best such drugs We came up with new drugs and again they worked until a few bacteria survived and multiplied The age of superbugs This is why we now have superbugs like MRSA multiple drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus and C difficile which spread easily in hospitals In 2005 94 000 Americans contracted MRSA and 18 650 died from it more than died from AIDS In Canada an estimated 220 000 hospital acquired infections result in at least 8 000 deaths a year According to the Public Health Agency of Canada drug resistant TB is not yet a problem here But out of 18 000 cases studied between 1998 and 2010 210 1 2 per cent were multi drug resistant and five 0 03 per cent were extremely drug resistant So the report of a totally drug resistant tuberculosis in India was not welcomed in India or anywhere else An Indian paper added to public worries by reporting in mid January that out of 100 randomly selected TB patients in Bangalore almost 1 000 kilometres from Mumbai six were carrying the TDR strain Impossible to contain A quick search on Google Scholar shows that the 12 Mumbai patients were not the first In 2006 an Iranian team in Tehran had identified 15 TDR TB cases in patients who included immigrants from Afghanistan Azerbaijan and Iraq And two women in Italy had died in 2003 after years of unsuccessful treatment with all available drugs This untreatable TB strain in other words has been around for over a decade and it has now turned up from Italy to Mumbai It seems unlikely that we will be able to contain it We can expect to find it in more places if only because we ll now be looking for it The implication of TDR TB is of course a rollback to the 19th century when consumption was a major cause of death around the world It is still a threat to poor people the World Health Organization says that one third of the world s population is currently infected with the TB bacillus WHO also estimates that 1 7 million people mostly Africans died of TB in 2009 4 657 deaths every day of the year So the prospect of untreatable TB is a disturbing one WHO notes that in the Americas only 2 1 persons per 100 000 die of TB With a totally drug resistant strain that rate could easily exceed Africa s current rate of 50 deaths per 100 000 Not everyone accepts the Mumbai findings The British medical journal The Lancet has reported on them without objections But WHO has published an FAQ that takes issue with the whole idea the term totally drug resistant tuberculosis is not yet recognised by the WHO For now these cases are extensively drug resistant tuberculosis XDR TB according to WHO definitions Indian health authorities have been quick to support WHO The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare also dismissed the Mumbai cases as XDR TB which itself was appalling when WHO first defined it in 2006 Grounds for caution Both institutions have reason to be politically cautious WHO was sharply criticized in 2009 when it declared the H1N1 flu to be a pandemic though very few people died from it India actively promotes medical tourism inviting westerners to take advantage of cheap surgery When the super resistant NDM 1 enzyme was identified last year in India the government and medical experts protested that it was just a plot to hurt the medical tourism industry Their effort at damage control backfired so WHO s skepticism about TDR TB was welcome This new strain of TB may yet succumb to some antibiotic we ll discover before long But even if we do succeed in controlling it our victory will be short lived TB and a host of other diseases will always mutate one step ahead of us Until we remove their root causes poverty malnutrition poor sanitation ignorance we will remain both their victims and their allies Crawford Kilian is a contributing editor of The Tyee "",""url"":""thetyee ca Opinion 2012 01 24 Incurable

expectancy even at relatively low levels of activity and regardless of body weight according to a study by a team of researchers led by the National Cancer Institute NCI part of the National Institutes of Health The study which found that people who engaged in leisure time physical activity had life expectancy gains of as much as 4 5 years appeared Nov 6 2012 in PLoS Medicine In order to determine the number of years of life gained from leisure time physical activity in adulthood which translates directly to an increase in life expectancy researchers examined data on more than 650 000 adults These people mostly age 40 and older took part in one of six population based studies that were designed to evaluate various aspects of cancer risk The U S Department of Health and Human Services the parent agency of NIH recommends that adults ages 18 to 64 engage in regular aerobic physical activity for 2 5 hours at moderate intensity or 1 25 hours at vigorous intensity each week Moderate activities are those during which a person could talk but not sing Vigorous activities are those during which a person could say only a few words without stopping for breath After accounting for other factors that could affect life expectancy the researchers found that life expectancy was 3 4 years longer for people who reported they got the recommend level of physical activity People who reported leisure time physical activity at twice the recommended level gained 4 2 years of life In general more physical activity corresponded to longer life expectancy The researchers even saw benefit at low levels of activity For example people who said they got half of the recommended amount of physical activity still added 1 8 years to their life Our findings highlight the important contribution that leisure time physical activity in adulthood can make to longevity said study author Steven Moore Ph D of NCI s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics and lead author of the study Regular exercise extended the lives in every group that we examined in our study normal weight overweight or obese The researchers found that the association between physical activity and life expectancy was similar between men and women and blacks gained more years of life expectancy than whites The relationship between life expectancy and physical activity was stronger among those with a history of cancer or heart disease than among people with no history of cancer or heart disease The researchers also examined how life expectancy changed with the combination of both activity and obesity Obesity was associated with a shorter life expectancy but physical activity helped to mitigate some of the harm People who were obese and inactive had a life expectancy that was between five to seven years shorter depending on their level of obesity than people who were normal weight and moderately active Physical activity has been shown to help maintain a healthy body weight maintain healthy bones muscles and joints promote psychological well being and reduce the risk of certain diseases including some cancers We must not underestimate how important physical activity is for health

not protein contribute to increase in body fat Public release date 3 Jan 2012 E mail Share Contact Sarah Kellersarah keller pbrf org225 763 3104JAMA and Archives Journals CHICAGO In a study conducted among 25 healthy individuals living in a controlled setting who were randomized to overconsumption of different levels of protein diets those consuming the low protein diet had less weight gain compared to those consuming normal and high protein diets and calories alone and not protein appeared to contribute to an increase in body fat according to a study in the January 4 issue of JAMA The researchers also found that protein did contribute to changes in energy expenditure and lean body mass Obesity has become a major public health concern with more than 60 percent of adults in the United States categorized as overweight and more than 30 percent as obese according to background information in the article The role of diet composition in response to overeating and energy dissipation is unclear George A Bray M D of the Pennington Biomedical Research Center Baton Rouge La and colleagues conducted a study to determine whether the level of dietary protein differentially affected body composition weight gain or energy expenditure under tightly controlled conditions The randomized controlled trial included 25 U S healthy weight stable male and female volunteers ages 18 to 35 years with a body mass index between 19 and 30 The first participant was admitted to the inpatient metabolic unit in June 2005 and the last in October 2007 After consuming a weight stabilizing diet for 13 to 25 days participants were randomized to receive diets containing 5 percent of energy from protein low protein 15 percent normal protein or 25 percent high protein which they were overfed during the last 8 weeks of their 10 to 12 week stay in the inpatient metabolic unit Compared with energy intake during the weight stabilization period the protein diets provided approximately 40 percent more energy intake which corresponds to 954 calories a day All participants in the study gained weight and there were no differences by sex The rate of weight gain in the low protein diet group was significantly less than in the other 2 groups 6 97 lbs 3 16 kg vs 13 3 lbs 6 05 kg for the normal protein diet group and 14 4 lbs 6 51 kg in the high protein diet group Body fat increased similarly in all 3 protein diet groups and represented 50 percent to more than 90 percent of the excess stored calories Resting energy expenditure total energy expenditure and body protein did not increase during overfeeding with the low protein diet the authors write Lean body mass body protein decreased during the overeating period by 1 5 lbs 0 70 kg in the low protein diet group compared with a gain of 6 3 lbs 2 87 kg in the normal protein diet group and 7 lbs 3 18 kg in the high protein diet group Resting energy expenditure normal protein diet 160 calories day high protein diet 227 calories day increased significantly with the normal and high protein diets In summary weight gain when eating a low protein diet 5 percent of energy from protein was blunted compared with weight gain when eating a normal protein diet 15 percent of energy from protein with the same number of extra calories Calories alone however contributed to the increase in body fat In contrast protein contributed to the changes in energy expenditure and lean body mass but not to the increase in body fat the researchers write The key finding of this study is that calories are more important than protein while consuming excess amounts of energy with respect to increases in body fat JAMA 2012 307 1 47 55 Available pre embargo to the media at www jamamedia org Editor s Note Please see the article for additional information including other authors author contributions and affiliations financial disclosures funding and support etc Editorial Overeating and Overweight Extra Calories Increase Fat Mass While Protein Increases Lean Mass In an accompanying editorial Zhaoping Li M D Ph D and David Heber M D Ph D of the University of California Los Angeles write that the results of this study informs primary care physicians and policy makers about the benefits of protein in weight management The results suggest that overeating low protein diets may increase fat deposition leading to loss of lean body mass despite lesser increases in body weight Policy makers and primary care physicians need to understand the role of the Western diet in promoting overweight and obesity Because this diet increases the risks of overnutrition through fat deposition beyond that detected by body mass index the method used to assess the current obesity epidemic and the magnitude of the obesity epidemic may have been underestimated Clinicians should consider assessing a patient s overall fatness rather than simply measuring body weight or body mass index and concentrate on the potential complications of excess fat accumulation The goals for obesity treatment should involve fat reduction rather than simply weight loss along with a better understanding of nutrition science

of pills that make looking good feel better than ever By Wil McCarthy It was chemical serendipity of billion dollar proportions a tanning drug with all the right side effects A hundred years ago being tan was bad because it meant you worked outside which meant you weren t rich By the 1970s tan lines had become associated with exercise tropical vacations and bumming around in skimpy clothing while others worked Tan was cultural tan was affluent tan was healthy UV induced tan was also unfortunately the cause of a sharp rise in skin cancer rates and premature wrinkles Hence a mid 80s research push at the University of Arizona to attack the problem from inside Being tan is healthy ironically people who work outdoors and see the sun every day are at low risk for skin cancer But getting tan is where the danger lies The faster it happens worst case a tanning booth the more harmful it is The U of A team which included endocrinologist Mac Hadley and dermatologist Norman Levine came upon a synthetic hormone a thousand times more potent than the body s own tanning triggers They called it Melanotan and pinned high hopes on its sunless ability to protect beautify and gently fleece the pale peoples of the world But that was only the beginning The molecule turns out to activate five different chemical systems throughout the body It s a potent anti inflammatory and in 1996 further tests of the drug showed that it also promotes sexual arousal Not simple vascular stimulation as with Viagra but a direct action in the hypothalamus the brain s emotional switchboard Impotence is largely an organic mechanical problem but here was something that could potentially address the murkier issues of frigidity and even that old time marriage killer simple lack of enthusiasm On Melanotan female lab rodents triple their levels of courtship behavior And as if that weren t enough the molecule also targets an appetite suppression receptor popular with the makers of weight loss drugs Yesterday s drugs were about need today s are about desire Call it the Barbie drug a pill or nasal spray that can make you thin tan pain free and horny all at once without effort How much would you pay Melanotan is just a glimpse of the coming age of fantasy drugs pills that will soothe and in fact reinforce social desires In the days before tan was cool overweight depressed bald and impotent were merely descriptive terms but today in America they re considered illnesses and are fought back with some 44 billion a year in direct medical expenses fast approaching the 50 billion we spend battling cancer And as the list of treatable disorders grows larger so does our medical ability to reshape both body and mind Yesterday s drugs were about need today s are about desire The unlocked human genome opens even our innermost passions to scrutiny and tinkering blazing the way to an entirely new class of pharmaceutical A more conservative more religious culture than ours might want doubt blockers or gnostogenics to empower their spiritual side But for better or worse Americans who pay for quick fix drugs will want beauty happiness and the illusion of wealth Nowhere is this more apparent than in the world of bodybuilding Let s face it building muscle is hard work and the people most intent on it are eager to speed the process But steroids have troublesome side effects like liver damage and violent behavior Fortunately the pharmaceutical industry rides to the rescue with an injectable called Insulin Like Growth Factor One or IGF 1 This is a muscle mass promoter that occurs naturally in the body and whose slow decrease after age 30 is probably responsible for the wasting process we associate with aging Shots of IGF 1 directly into muscle tissue have been shown to aid in muscle growth and to reverse wasting not only from old age but also from diseases such as muscular dystrophy But the effect which is localized at the injection site soon wears off allowing normal or subnormal muscle mass to return Enter biotech which can not only synthesize the protein from scratch but also package it in the form of engineered viruses that insert IGF 1 genes directly into muscle cells allowing them to produce their own growth factor indefinitely Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have already created dozens of muscle bound Mighty Mouse look alikes from ordinary lab rodents Injecting these viruses into people will be a slow carefully monitored process but it s only a matter of time before the street gets ahold of IGF If Melanotan is Barbie s drug then surely the IGF 1 virus belongs to Ken who ll use it to build the pecs and lats she so adores without filling up his calendar or wiping the sunny boy next door smile off his face In fact with both these drugs acting in concert Ken and Barbie will be prettier than ever and have a lot more time to spend together But what about Barbie s kid sister Skipper Locked in perpetual adolescence too young for sex or drugs Does biotech hold any promise for her Happily yes Food scientists in Garching Germany have developed a molecular big chill to turbocharge her snacks and soft drinks Special nerve endings in the skin and especially on the tongue and cheeks and palate are designed to measure temperature and give a gentle or not so gentle warning when they come in contact with surfaces that are too hot or too cold Our mouths know the difference between ice cubes and hot soup Still these nerves are chemical machines and there are chemicals that can fool them Capsaicin the active ingredient in peppers is hot because its precise molecular shape locks onto our heat receptors triggering physiological reactions like sweating and flushing Similarly menthol the distilled essence of peppermints triggers a sensation of cold that deadens pain in the same way ice does Contributing editor Wil McCarthy wmccarth sprynet com wrote about Moore s law in Wired 10 01 Page 2 Previous Story Change Next Story

man I don t know what went wrong there It usually works Here let s try it again Assume the position I ve been tricked by the nickel trick before Now I do it to everyone I know arothman sees your fail

have fallen for that Maybe twice Mack Jul 28th 2006 2 50 PM 47 What exactly was he pretending the trick to be And why would the other guy need to hold onto the balls I just need to know so I can pull this trick off myself So how does one cause the ball to jump off the table like that anyway All you have to do is be able to hit the cue ball straight If you can hit the nickle or what ever object you want to hop the cue ball will jump You just need something that has enough mass that it won t shoot away when the cue ball hits it and is thick enough that the cue ball has to leave the table to go

the final result it just makes me so happy Whenever we buy fruits all I can think of are all the pastries I can make with them These peach strudels are so adorable and so scrumptious You can really fill them with anything you prefer like apples cherries apricots etc This recipe will make 8 strudels so if you want more you can double the recipe Start by warming up half the milk in a microwave for about 20 seconds you don t want it boiling To the milk add a teaspoon of honey and a couple tablespoons of flour Mix it all well then add the yeast Whisk it all well together and let it sit for about half hour After half hour if your yeast was not expired the dough starter should have doubled up in size Now add this dough starter to the mixer bowl and add the egg and the sugar Mix it well until it s well incorporated Add the flour to the bowl the butter vanilla extract the remaining milk salt and mix well on medium speed for a couple minutes The dough should be soft and pliable Form in a ball and let it rise in a warm spot While the dough is rising you can get the peaches ready You ll need about 3 large peaches for the 8 strudels Wash the peaches and peel them and remove the pits Cut them up in slices they don t have to be too thin In a small sauce pan add the peaches and 1 4 cup of sugar Turn the heat to medium and cook the peaches for about 5 minutes Let the peaches cool they need to be cold before we add them to the pastry The dough should take about an hour to double in size Cut the dough in 8 equal pieces and roll each one of them up in a ball Let them rest for another half hour and they will double in size After half hour take one of the balls and roll it out into a rectangle about 6 inches wide and 6 inches long Place a heaping tablespoon of the peach filling into the middle of the rectangle and fold one of the sides over the filling Use a fork to seam the dough Now take a pair of scissors and cut the other third of the dough into thin strips as you see in the picture below This is a bit of a messy job but a lot of fun Now take each long strip and fold it over the roll and tuck it in underneath Continue this with the remaining dough and peaches Place them on a cookie sheet lined with a silpat or parchment paper and let them rest for about 10 minutes Before baking brush each strudel with egg wash and bake in the oven at 375 F degrees for about 30 minutes or until golden brown They look so cute and adorable and trust me they taste delicious too Ingredients 2 cups all purpose flour 1 2 cup sugar 1 tsp honey 75 ml milk 1 egg 1 2 stick butter 1

"http://www.mensjournal.com/a-field-guide-to-sports-egos"	"4345"	"{""title"":""A Field Guide to Sports Egos Men s Journal "",""body"":""By Matt Taibbi According to a new report by the United Nations global narcissism rose 4 9 percent in 2009 the highest one year leap since the Great Self Importance Wave of 1991 which featured career years from the likes of Saddam Hussein Michael Jackson and Oliver Stone And while the secondary research isn t in yet we can guess that pro sports figures played a big role in the statistical surge as athletes like Tiger Woods A Rod and Kobe Bryant have continued to take the lead in teaching children that true love doesn t always have to involve other people Pro sports and narcissism have always been a natural match and it s no wonder For all sorts of reasons mainly distracting the masses from their dreary lives of cubicle labor and haggard late night internet masturbation the world needs its infallible triumphant oversexed heroes and sports does a great job of creating them That s why what we call sports journalism is most of the time a kind of mechanized admiration society where panels full of breathless ex jocks team up with human thesauruses to furiously burnish the legends of genetic lottery winners EX JOCK ANALYST NO 1 Look at the way he darts through the hole Look at the power Look at the acceleration Those arm tackles just aren t gonna work on Adrian Peterson EXCITABLE HOST Whoop He could go all the way EX JOCK ANALYST NO 1 I mean it Boom If Peterson were here right now I d suck his cock EX JOCK ANALYST NO 2 Oh me too Jaws I mean I bet he s got a schlong like a parking meter The whole panel laughs This is all fine one of the less toxic varieties of media horseshit but it has one drawback The players in question often actually believe this stuff which is why some of them go completely over the self regarding edge never to return to our planet It doesn t happen all at once but in steps and in hindsight we usually should have seen it coming Stage One Dustin Pedroia The Red Sox s Munchkinland escapee is a good example of an athlete who s managed to remain in that first stage of gentle tadpole narcissism on the correct side of a spectrum that stretches to say Benito Mussolini When it comes to sports bragging the laws of physics as described by Roger Rabbit apply It only works when it s funny In other words as long as it s a 5 foot nothing guy puffing his chest and raving about how shredded he is calling guys twice his size meat and telling his teammates to bring your glasses for the laser show when he hits it s relatively harmless But inevitably the guy who opts for that Muhammad Ali I am the king of the world clowning shtick goes to the well one too many times and next thing you know he s holding shirtless pressers on his front lawn or legally changing his name to Super Duper or pimping a new home appliance line coming soon the Starbury nautical toaster Stage Two Chad Ochocinco Chad Whateverhisnameis was once a genuinely funny guy one who managed to pull off stunts like his notorious Who Covered 85 in 05 checklist of torched defensive backs without seeming like too much of a tool If anything it seemed at first like Ochocinco n\u00e9e Johnson s self directed humor fell short not because it was pathological but because it might have been contrived maybe with the aid of some drearily endorsement hungry marketing consultant But then Ocho not only went through with his puzzling and mildly annoying legal name change couldn t he have picked something catchy \u00e0 la World B Free like Enormous Johnson but also named not one but two children after himself there s a Chade and a Chad II the latter a sure sign he had moved into the more dangerous second stage of self importance Stage Three Rickey Henderson They actually have a word for what Rickey Henderson is illeist The early usage of this word referred to someone who used the third person pronoun he to refer to himself but in Rickey s case he was insufficiently majestic so Rickey always used Rickey His all time money quote is his legendary phone call to then Padres GM Kevin Towers in search of a job Kevin this is Rickey Calling on behalf of Rickey Rickey wants to play baseball A former Mariners teammate reported that Rickey would come into the clubhouse wearing a suede hat and announce Rickey got a big ranch Rickey got a big bull Rickey got horses Rickey got chickens and everything Lots of athletes make it to the illeist stage A LeBron James team is never desperate is one recent example but none would have gotten there without Rickey Stage Four Michael Jordan Joking with teammates in the dugout about how Rickey got chickens is one thing It s another to deliver a prepared Hall of Fame acceptance speech an epitaph for your career and tell the crowd Don t be in a rush to try to find the next Michael Jordan There s not going to be a next Michael Jordan The awesome thing about His Airness s narcissism is how completely blunt humorless and matter of fact it is He says things that could literally induce vomit if you thought about them long enough a great example being his not joking at all message to his own children during his Springfield speech You guys have a heavy burden I wouldn t want to be you guys To reach the Jordan stage is to completely believe your own bullshit and move toward the Caligula model of personality development bored with the society of mere people or my supporting cast as Jordan would describe them and feeling close only to the gods Stage Five Tiger Woods Stylistically Tiger doesn t really belong with a lot of the guys on this list he doesn t need a self aggrandizing midcareer legal name change and it s hard to imagine him wearing a Jose Canseco style see through chemise but he does ably represent one key element of the self importance game the total inability to grasp concepts like empathy loyalty and shame That generally means you need an agent or a lawyer to tell you you re sorry for humiliating your wife with every fake titted skank in the Western hemisphere and if you do issue a public apology for said transgressions you do so in a way that is actually both self congratulatory I have not been true to my values and shifts the blame onto others I have been dismayed to realize the full extent of what tabloid scrutiny really means It s no coincidence that Tiger takes his cues from another notorious egomaniac He reportedly discussed plans to buy a Kobe special a reference to the 4 million diamond ring Bryant bought his wife after his own gash hounding became public Stage Six Charles Haley Even supreme egomaniacs like Kobe know better than to just run off the court in the middle of a game and start mounting cheerleaders Former NFL star Charles Haley the great car tossing defensive end of the 49ers and Cowboys of the late 80s and 90s wasn t quite that bad but he was close treating the whole world like his personal Eden expanding upon Rickey Henderson s propensity for near constant locker room nakedness to the point where police probably should have been called Haley would wave his Godzilla tail in front of teammates and say things like You know you wanna suck this Or during team meetings jerk himself off to ejaculation while talking about other players wives Whether this is narcissism or just sociopathic insanity is an interesting question but regardless Haley represents a class of athletes who make it all the way to adulthood without ever having to think about anything beyond the simple question Where do I stick my penis next The Final Stage Alex Rodriguez The satirist Ambrose Bierce once wrote that there are only two instruments worse than a clarinet two clarinets In that vein only one athlete could be more narcissistic than the one who commissions a portrait of himself in the form of a centaur and that is the athlete who commissions two Alex Rodriguez Now obviously A Rod is an easy target because among other things he allowed himself to be photographed kissing his own image in a mirror But make no mistake he earned his status as the reigning sports narcissist long before that He s issued more insincere lawyer drafted apologies than Kobe and Tiger combined his two daughters share the middle name Alexander and his breezily humorless self congratulation easily reaches Michael Jordan levels A Rod on why people criticize him I don t know if it s because I m good looking I m biracial I make the most money This is a guy who once picked the middle innings of a World Series game to announce he was bailing on his contract and you get the impression that he would have passed a polygraph as he lied to Katie Couric about steroids since he probably didn t believe he had done anything wrong Even after signing for 250 million winning multiple MVP awards and gorging himself on a veritable mountain of stripper flesh A Rod was still so desperate for attention that he felt a need to brag to his mortified teammates about how he spelunkered the elderly pop star Madonna In sum A Rod is the rare person who would ace all 40 questions on the Pinsky narcissism test and he might get extra points for No 29 I like to look at myself in the mirror This article originally appeared in the the March 2010 issue of Men s Journal "",""url"":""mensjournal a field guide to sports

kneading required!"",""body"":""Posted by Ree in All PW Recipes Breads Sides Staples Thanksgiving Since I ve kept you all waiting I m not going to do my usual ten minute monologue waxing rhapsodic on the recipe I m about to give you But I will summarize this roll recipe by saying a they re a cinch to make b they re totally tasty and c I can t think of a c So let s get started shall we The Cast of Characters Flour Sugar Milk Vegetable Oil Salt and Active Dry Yeast Everyone has this stuff Begin with 4 cups of milk Pour the milk into a stock pot or dutch oven To the milk add 1 cup of sugar And 1 cup of vegetable oil Stir to combine Now turn the burner on medium to medium low and scald the mixture which means heat it up just until the point that it would boil Before the mixture boils turn off the heat Note At this point in the game I have walked away and forgotten about it more times than I care to count If you come back to the stove and it s boiling don t freak out Just turn off the heat and it ll be fine NOW Very important stuff here walk away Walk away and allow this mixture to cool to warm lukewarm The mixture will need to be warm enough to be a hospitable environment for the yeast but not so hot that it kills the yeast and make it inactive I don t usually use a thermometer but if you d like to a good temp is between 90 and 110 degrees I usually feel the side of the pan with the palm of my hand If it s hot at all I wait another 20 minutes or so The pan should feel comfortably warm When you re ready throw in 4 cups of flour Then sprinkle in 2 packages or 4 1 2 teaspoons Active Dry Yeast Stir together to get the yeast into the warm moistness Warm moistness for some reason that phrase makes me want to take a nap I can t explain why After the yeast and flour are nicely incorporated add another 4 cups of flour The reason I didn t add the 8 cups all together is that I wanted to give the yeast a chance to mingle with the warmth a little more Stir together and allow to sit covered with a tea towel or lid for an hour The dough will seem overly sticky Make sure you don t set it next to a freezing cold window it s best if it s in a relatively warm environment Near the stove is fine After an hour or so the mixture will have poufed up quite a bit Here s what mine looked like If yours doesn t look like it s changed much put it in a warm but turned off oven for 45 minutes or so Now to finish it off add 1 more cup of flour 1 heaping more than level teaspoon baking powder 1 scant less than level teaspoon baking soda And 2 tablespoons salt Now stir together until combined It ll be a little tough to stir so sometimes I ll knead it around on the countertip a few times just to get the ingredients combined But remember with this dough there s NO NEED TO KNEAD When it s all mixed you can put it in the fridge covered for up to two days before using the dough which means you can go make the dough NOW if you re using it tomorrow Or if you make it the day of you can just leave it on the counter until you need it Keep in mind though that the dough will continue to rise though more slowly in the fridge so you ll have to occasionally punch it down if it overflows NOTE If you do refrigerate the dough be sure to remove it from the fridge an hour or two before you need it When you re ready to make the rolls here s what to do Butter 1 or 2 muffin pans depending on how many rolls you need Don t be shy turkeys Lay it on as thick as you want I like to poke the dough It s fun and makes me feel kind of funky inside To form the rolls pinch off a walnut sized piece of dough Make like a six year old and roll it into a ball Repeat and tuck three balls of dough into each buttered muffin tin Continue until the pan is full Now it s very important to give the rolls plenty of room to RISE as that will make all the difference in the ultimate consistency of the rolls How quickly they rise depends on many factors how warm the room is where the pan is and whether or not the yeast is in a good mood that day I always allow myself a good 2 to 3 hours before the meal to allow the rolls to rise as there s nothing worse than having to bake flat rolls This is what the rolls looked like after an hour of rising The dough had been slightly cold when I formed the balls so the rising process moved along a little slowly I decided to speed up the process a little by heating up a long griddle on my stovetop then turn off the heat and place the muffin pan on top This provided a little more warmth just enough to make the yeast jump for joy Here they are after another thirty minutes or so I went ahead and baked them at this point but they could have risen for another thirty minutes or so Give dem rolls plenty of time my friends Bake at 400 degrees until golden brown about 20 minutes Keep your eye on them though I m the biggest roll burner there is and you shouldn t listen to me If you think of it ahead of time you can brush melted butter on the tops of the unbaked rolls Or you can brush the tops with eggs whites and sprinkle them with poppyseeds Or if you re lazy like me you can just do this Or you can just leave them plain Put them into a bread basket and take a big whiff They re not smooth and perfect and aesthetically flawless but they re rustic and charming Oh and delicious Mmmmm This is my favorite part See how conveniently the sections open up for you They re just begging for butter Listen you can hear them Butter please Butter please Butter Butter Butter You d better go do what they say Happy Thanksgiving everyone And for Christmas

If it hasn t changed much put it in a warm but turned off oven for 45 minutes or so When it had risen sufficiently add 1 more cup of flour 1 heaping teaspoon of baking powder 1 scant teaspoon of
