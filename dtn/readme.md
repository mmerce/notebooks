workspace.

In addition to that, as members of DTN you will be able to collaborate in the
DTN organization. Once you join the DTN organization, the new
workspace will appear in your Dashboard in addition to your personal workspace:

## Automation


### Training and prediction workflow

This is an iPython Notebook in Google Colab. It describes the entire workflow
to upload data to BigML and train a model that can instantly be used to do
predictions for diabetes.
